The peak of the rains is expected around mid October/early November and end of rains around late December. There is high likelihood that on and off rains are expected to continue up to January and February 2013 over this region. Therefore, farmers are advised to do the following: Plant long maturing crops like millet,rice, sorghum,maize, cassava, sweet potatoes on the start of rains and short quick maturing crops later on ( beans, tomatoes, vegetables) as rains progress. Prunning of crops like fruit trees(avocado, apples, mangoes, oranges), should be undertaken. Construction of drainage and diversion channels on crop plots and parcels incase of heavy rains. Put in place soil conservation structures to prevent soil erosion for those on slopes and highlands. Crop pests and diseases attacking green vegetables are likely to be common. Planting of pastures can be undertaken including the improvement of the exist ones. Guard against tickborne diseases and worms. Advise farmers to undertake planting of trees during the good rains to act as windbreakers in future and income source. Construct proper drainage systems around the houses to lead rainwater away.

Compost and farm yard manure can be prepared using the same method. It is only the materials that are used to make that change. Compost is made from kitchen waste and green plants. Farm yard manure is made from animal waste and remains of feeds. Collect the materials to be used and mix them very well. Heap them in one pit or make a heap and pour water. Keep mixing them; if it is in a heap, transfer it to another pit so that the materials on the underside are on the top side. Keep adding some water. You can put a long stick in the middle to test whether the manure has decomposing.

Prunning of crops like fruit trees(avocado, apples, mangoes, oranges), bananas and coffee trees  should be undertaken. Construction of drainage and diversion channels on crop plots and parcels incase of heavy rains. Put in place  soil conservation structures to prevent soil erosion for those on slopes and  highlands. Crop pests and diseases attacking green vegetables are likely to be common. Planting of pastures can be undertaken including the improvement of  the exist ones. Guard against tickborne diseases and worms. Advise farmers to undertake planting of trees during the good rains to act as windbreakers in future and income source. Harvesting root tube crops ( cassava, sweet potatoes) to avoid damage by heavy rains. Construct proper drainage systems around the houses to lead rainwater away. Have and use pit latrines.

Damping-off is another serious problem in the nursery management and it is a combined name for a number of non-specific fungal diseases that cause a serious threat to seedlings after germination. The seedlings begin to rot from the stem tissue just above the soil level (root collar) resulting in the seedlings drying and falling over. The disease begins in patches (spots) and finally spreads to the entire bed. The moist environment created for the maximum growth of the seedlings also favours the growth of the fungi. \r\nPrevention and Control:\r\nIf the attack is at an early stage, chemicals, such as copper oxide and Benlate (Benomyl 50%) are available in Uganda and can be used. The dosage must be according to the instructions of manufacturer. The dosage must be according to the instructions of manufacturer but care needs to be taken not to always use the same product (fungicide) since damping off may fail to be controlled by a particular product or fungicide (resistance may build).  Good spraying frequency is 2 to 3 times a week. Spraying must be done in the afternoon and no watering must be done after spraying. All infected stock must be removed and burnt as soon as possible, if at least 70% of seedlings have been attacked, burn all seedlings, and do not reuse the soil used previously for planting the seedlings, all sowing equipment and the germination environment must be disinfected either through applying fungicides like benomyl or heat the soil before planting. You can prevent damping off by: Controlling moisture (water in the soil), reducing on the shade in the nursery bed, controlling the amount of water used during irrigation, and thorough cleaning of sowing tools and equipment. Note that, the disease occurs in very wet conditions, often caused by over watering and excessive shading (too much shade). Because of the quick spread of the disease, you have to control it immediately.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 14:56:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TDkOAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kisalizi","id":"a0r70000000TDkTAAW","content":"Fabiano 0754966068\r\nSupplies to Masindi and Hoima districts\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Grameen foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 13:53:22\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TDkJAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Tree and fruit seedlings","id":"a0r70000000TDkOAAW","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-29 13:52:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Syw1AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Abok","id":"a0r70000000Sz8BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sz7SAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ogwal Trading center B","id":"a0r70000000Sz9iAAC","content":"Stores Maize ,Beans, Cotton, soya Beans, Simsim , in Bags.

The period between planting and harvesting for maize depend upon the variety planted. Harvesting should be done during the dry weather. After harvesting, maize needs to be properly dried, threshed and cleaned before it is stored. Maize stores like cribs or granaries should be well cleaned or fumigated using the right chemical. Maize can also be treated with the right chemical before it is stored. Use clean sisal and nylon sacks for proper maize storage. A lot of maize is lost during harvesting (50% loss), so farmers should aim at reducing this loss. It is good for the farmer not to sell maize immediately after harvesting, if maize is kept for some time after harvesting, it will be sold at a slightly higher price when the demand for maize has increased. In order for farmers to identify markets for maize, they should Join or establish farmer groups so that they can collectively produce enough maize and be able to negotiate good market prices Farmers can get in touch with the National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) and the Agricultural staff at the district to advice on possible market outlets. Also farmers have the opportunity to contact Grameen Foundation farmer call centre on 178 or 0312178178 for the current maize prices and market.\r\nFarmers are advised to keep records from land preparation to marketing to help them determine whether they are making profits or losses and thereafter can decide whether to plant maize again or whether to improve on the maize production techniques to get more yields.\n\nAttribution: Information Compiled by Grameen Foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-15 10:07:10\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGkeAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000TH6FAAW","content":"Maize needs a lot of nutrients or food from the soil to give better yields that is why maize responds well to fertilizers like DAP, UREA and NPK.

But the Open Pollinated Varieties (OPVs), maize seeds can be saved and replanted up to 3 times without use of fertilizers and still yield well. Also some maize varieties can only be grown in highland or mountain areas and others are good for lowland areas. Farmers should avoid using seeds saved from previous season crop due to reduced yields, diseases and pest problems.

When mulching, farmers should place mulch atleast 10cm away from coffee plants to prevent rotting of the coffee stems and the thickness of the mulch layer should not exceed 10cm so that water can enter into the soil easily.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StxFAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nitrogenous fertilisers","id":"a0r70000000Su0FAAS","content":"These contain nitrogen (N) as the major nutrient.

ACMD is one of the most serious and widespread diseases throughout cassava growing areas in Africa  causing yield reductions. It is caused by a complex of viruses and transmitted through infected cuttings and whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci). The best control measure is to plant resistant varieties and to use disease-free planting materials. If it is not possible to find completely disease free stems  select cuttings from stem branches instead of from the main stem. Stem cuttings from the branches are more likely to sprout into disease-free plants than stem cuttings from the main stems.

CBB is caused by bacteria  Xanthomonas sp. As control  plant resistant or at least tolerant varieties. Plants infected at an early stage should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted entirely and burnt. If complete outbreaks on whole farms are observed  it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning. Infected plant debris may also be ploughed deep into soil. In both situations the land must be allowed to fallow for few years (3 years minimum) before it is planted again to cassava. The bacterium responsible for the disease is unable to survive over a long period outside the host. In communities where land for peasant farming is scarce  fallowing of land may not be a good disease control option.  After destruction of infected plant debris as described in the preceding section  cereals  grains or legumes can be planted on the same piece of land. After three seasons the land can be returned to cassava. Farmers must consciously harvest stems from healthy plants completely free of any of the described symptoms of the disease (i.e. use clean planting materials). It is generally wise to avoid using planting materials from any farm suspected to be under CBB attack even if symptoms of the disease have not been observed on plants. Grasshoppers and other insects that can serve as carriers of the bacterium from farm to farm must be controlled using environmentally friendly measures. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of CBB. Destroy plant debris (remains).\n\nAttribution: IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sore-like sores on stem","id":"a0r70000000SteGAAS","content":"If cankers or sore-like sore appear on the stems; Cankers may develop cracks  exposing inner tissues of stems to the external environment.

Young plants are usually harvested in stages  while old plants are more commonly uprooted to prevent the storage roots becoming very fibrous. As cassava roots do not keep fresh more than 2-3 days after harvesting  not all plants are harvested at once  but rather harvesting as the roots are consumed. When cassava is grown for urban markets they are harvested in large amounts. Cassava is usually harvested 9-12 months after planting. It is sometimes harvested earlier if needed for food. Storage roots become too woody if harvesting is delayed. Early maturing varieties are ready for harvesting at 7 months while late maturing varieties are ready 12 months after planting.   Average yields are between 3-4 tons of fresh tubers per acre (7.5-10 tons per ha) although with reasonable care and attention yields of up to 10 tons per acre (25 tons per ha) and more are possible. The ratio of fresh tubers to peeled and dried chips is about 3:1. Cassava does not store well when fresh and therefore has to be peeled  chopped and dried in the sun. During post harvest cassava is peeled and cut into smaller pieces or grating and pressing into small balls before drying. To make flour   pound or grind in a mill the dry slices or balls.

Over mature cuttings have dormant nodes  are lignified and have very little nutrients  while very young cuttings dehydrate easily and are susceptible to pathogens. In case of delay in planting  store cuttings in a dry  well-ventilated  shaded areas away from direct sunlight. Avoid thin stems as they have less nutrients and moisture resulting in weak sprouts that can produce only a few tuberous roots; very big stems are bulky. Medium stems are best. Use cuttings with about 5-7 nodes to increase spouting chances. Small cuttings lose viability and moisture very easily and that may affect spouting ability and establishment. Healthy stems should be used. Avoid bruising stems  as bruises can be entry points for pathogens. Diseased stems sprout poorly.

A healthy bird is active, feeds normally and does not drink too much water; healthy chicken also pass out normal droppings (not too watery) and the birds will make normal sounds and movements.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Methods of using vaccines and diseases that can be vaccinated","id":"a0r70000000StQbAAK","content":"There are different ways of administering (giving) vaccines to chicken; the method used to apply a particular vaccine depends on the instructions or recommendations of the manufaturer of the vaccine.

Alot of care has to be used when handling, transporting, storing and using vaccines on chicken. When storing vaccines, they should be kept frozen (in a fridge or freezer) until they are required to be used. Vaccines must not be mixed using ordinary tap water; there are correct diluents or solvents (liquids used to dilute vaccines) that suppliers should provide to the farmers and farmers should ask for advice on how to use these solvents when mixing a vaccine. After a vaccine has been mixed (diluted or dissolved), it must be kept on ice and should be used within atleast 2 hours; a vaccine will lose its ability to work well if it is kept for more than 4 hours after it has been diluted.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StP5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Drinkers","id":"a0r70000000StQdAAK","content":"Drinkers are equipment used to provide drinking water to chicken.

If temperatures are right chicks will be evenly spread out in a brooder, if temperatures are too low the chicks will all crowd around the heat source and if temperatures are too high chicks will move away from the heat source and keep on the edges of the brooder. If temperatures are too high in a brooder (above 25 C) for a long time then chicks will eat less and the rate at which they grow will reduce.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StP7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Handling new chicks","id":"a0r70000000StQlAAK","content":"Chicks should be put in a brooder between 6 and 12 hours after hatching.

Open parts (like ventilators and windows) of the chicken house should be covered with a wire mesh to keep out wild birds and rats since these can spread diseases to chicken. Farmers should also keep one type of poultry in a house; they should not mix chicken with turkeys or ducks. Birds of different ages should be kept separately; this helps prevent diseases from spreading from birds of one age to those of another age (younger birds are more easily affected by diseases than older birds). The chicken house must have one room set aside from where sick chicken are treated from without mixing them with other healthy chicken.

Farmers planning to use artificial feeding need to teach their calves how to feed from a bucket. TEACHING CALVES HOW TO FEED FROM A BUCKET: Put 2 fingers in the calf's mouth so that it starts to suck, gently lower the calf's mouth into the colostrum (first milk the cow produces) that has ben milked into a bucket, slowly remove the fingers from the calf's mouth and the calf will start drinking from the bucket. ADVANTAGES of artificial feeding include being easy for farmers to control the amount of milk given to the calf and to keep records of each calf's consumption. It also makes it easier for farmers to teach calves how to feed, calves can feed in a quiet place without any disturbance and it also makes it possible to record and monitor how much milk a cow is producing. Also when artificial feeding is being used and a calf dies or is taken away the cow's milk production will not be affected. WARNING: Farmers should never give calves too much milk because this can cause diarrhea or dysentery (if this occurs the amount of milk being given to the calf should be reduced by half and should be mixed with an equal amount of water). Milk should be given to a calf immediately after milking when the milk is still at the body temperature of the cow. Farmers should observe cleanliness and hygiene (all equipment used to handle milk should be clean) to protect calves from diseases. After 3 weeks farmers should start providing clean water for the claves at all times. A mineral lick should also be hanged in a place where calves can reach so that they can get minerals they need from it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"lobed leaves red stalk green stem high branching large roots long neck brown outer skin cream inner skin","id":"a0r70000000StetAAC","content":"MM92/0067/Akena has lobed leaves  red stalk  green stem and high branching abilities  shooting ability (2); large roots with long neck  brown outer skin and cream inner skin; resistant to Cassava mosaic disease (CMD)  tolerant to Cassava brown streak disease (Cassava Brown streak Disease)  Cassava Brown streak Disease leaf symptoms are rare and Cassava Brown streak Disease root symptoms are visible but rare; tolerant to cassava green mite and whiteflies; roots taste sweet and with low cyanide content; root yield is more than 16 tons/acre\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small leaves red or purple stalk dark grey stem highly branching moderate roots short neck brown outer skin purple inner skin","id":"a0r70000000SteuAAC","content":"MH972961 has small leaves  red/purple stalk  dark grey stem  highly branching (3); moderate roots with short neck  brown outer skin and purple inner skin; resistant to Cassava Mossaic Disease (CMD)  torelant to Cassava Brown streak Disease  Cassava Brown streak Disease leaf symptom are rare and Cassava Brown streak Disease root symptom visible but very rare; tolerant to cassava green mite and whiteflies; roots taste sweet and with low cyanide content; root yield is more than 10 tons/acre.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StW1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fertiliser application","id":"a0r70000000StevAAC","content":"Beans need fertile soil to grow well so farmers should apply fertilisers if they plant beans on infertile soil.

To control bean flies, farmers should remove and destroy remaining parts of bean plants which show signs of having bean flies.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:13\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mbarara Kasese road","id":"a0r70000000SuICAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Liberation road","id":"a0r70000000SuIDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Customs road","id":"a0r70000000SuIEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Taxi Park","id":"a0r70000000SuIFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Naboa road","id":"a0r70000000SuIGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bunghoko Sub county","id":"a0r70000000SuIHAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bamuluya trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Andrews Cathedral","id":"a0r70000000SuIJAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kumi road","id":"a0r70000000SuIKAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Manafa road","id":"a0r70000000SuILAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bishop Wasike road","id":"a0r70000000SuIMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"St Pauls College","id":"a0r70000000SuINAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI7AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Republic Street","id":"a0r70000000SuIOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI8AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pabbo trading centre","id":"a0r70000000SuIPAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuI9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Anaka trading center","id":"a0r70000000SuIQAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:36:27\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXCAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Reducing leaves on banana plants","id":"a0r70000000StivAAC","content":"Farmers should remove only old, dead, broken and those that are turning yellow.

They are small, very mobile insects that are white and first and later on develop a brown or pale yellow color. Farmers can separate onion leaves and look carefully if they want to see the thrips and the damage they cause on onion leaves. SIGNS: Thrips make small holes on the upper surface of onion leaves and feed on the plant sap especially from leaves that are just developing deep inside the onion plant; this results in leaves having white and silvery patches. If too many thrips attack an onion plant the tips of leaves on the plant will turn brownish, growth of the plant will slow down, leaves and the onions developing on the plant will lose their normal shape and the onions developing on the plant will reduce in size. Although thrips cause most damage when they attack onions plants that are in the early bulbing stage (forming onions on the plant), farmers should always try to control thrips before the plants reach this stage so that thrips in the garden do not become too many since these are hard to control. Thrips that attack onion plants towards harvesting time (even if the thrips are many) cause little damage since at this stage the onion plants can tolerate thrip attacks. Thrip attacks are usually more serious during dry seasons and at such times whole onion gardens can be destroyed by these pests. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers can prevent thrips from attacking their onion gardens by keeping them well irrigated (dry onion plants are more likely to get attacked by thrips than well watered ones). Weeds and onion plants that are attacked by too many thrips should be removed from the garden.  Thrips can be controlled by spraying affected plants with locally made neem pesticides but farmers MUST get advice from agricultural personnel in the area because some neem pesticides can be harmful to onions that are still growing.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StPrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Natural feeding","id":"a0r70000000StQvAAK","content":"This involves allowing calves to suckle (take milk) directly from their mother's teats.

fly maggots White or cream maggots on lower part of stem blueish leaves which later dry up whole onion plants drying up and sometimes dying","id":"a0r70000000Stj8AAC","content":"This is caused by onion flies (brownish grey flies that are smaller than ordinary house flies); the flies lay eggs in soil from which maggots develop and greatly damage onion plants as they feed. Young ones of onion flies (maggots) are major pests for onions. Onion fly maggots are small (about 0.8 cm when they are fully grown) and are white to cream in color. They feed on onion roots that branch off from the main root from which they enter the main root and make holes inside it and sometimes they can even reach the lower part of the stem. Leaves on onion plants that are affected will dry up and turn abit blue in color; the plants dry up, reduce in size and may eventually die. Onion fly maggots can kill seedlings by feeding just above the lower parts of the seedlings; a maggot can attack several seedlings one after the other and this causes poor plant establishment resulting in many gaps in the garden. Onion fly maggots are also found inside onions developing on the affected plant. As the onion fly maggots feed, they expose the plant to diseases like bacterial soft rot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should avoid planting onions in soil that has alot of organic matter that is not yet well rotted (such as soil on which animals have just been grazing) and soil that has alot of weeds. Onion flies usually lay their eggs in soil that is wet, and contains a high amount of organic matter (manure and left over plant material).  Farmers should not plant onions in a garden unless the left over plant material is dry and completely rotten. If animal manure is being used as a fertiliser then farmers should allow enough time for the manure to rot and break down before they plant onions. Onions should also not be planted in a garden season after season; farmers should practice crop rotation with crops that are not in the onion family (crops like garlic should not be used in the rotation). Onion gardens should be kept well separated and onions grown in a season following an attack from onion fly maggots should be planted as far away as possible from the soil on which the affected onions were growing in the previous season. All onion plants that are affected by onion fly maggots should be removed from the garden and destroyed (by burning). To prevent onion flies farmers should carefully plough (dig into the soil) plant remains immediately after harvesting is done and the soil should be regularly dug and turned so that young ones of onion flies can be Turn soil to killed. Farmers can also place powdered hot pepper or ginger around onion stems since this helps control the numbers of onion flies in an onion garden. Locally made pesticides made from neem products can also help prevent onion flies from laying eggs in onion gardens if they are sprayed on the onions and soil.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXFAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leaf miners Rotting on parts where leaves start from and white or yellow lines developing on leaves curling and loss of normal leaf shape and plants rotting","id":"a0r70000000Stj9AAC","content":"This is caused by pests called leaf miners; damage cause by leaf miners is usually not serious (may only make onions lose their healthy appearance and may make them rejected at the market) and they do not affect growth of onions.

When affected onion plants are pulled out of the soil their roots wil be dark brown, flattened, hollow (having empty insides) and transparent. When onions affected by fusarium basal rot are cut (from top to bottom) a change in color from white to brown will be seen in the inner parts of the onion. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should be careful not to damage roots of onion plants in the garden and onion bulbs should be handled carefully during harvesting. Farmers should also properly dry onions in the sun for a few days before they are stored; this helps to dry outer layers of the onion skins so that the inner parts are protected.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Onion rust disease small reddish or orange spots on leaves yellowing of leaves which die when onion plant is still young smaller reduced size of onions growing on plant","id":"a0r70000000StjBAAS","content":"This disease is called onion rust.

Later many small black things (about the size of the top of a pin or small needle) develop on the affected onions. Leaves of affected onion plants will rot on their lower ends, turn yellow, dry up, die and fall off the onion plant; old leaves on the affected onion plant usually die first.

White bulb rot can stay in soil for a long time and affect onions that are planted later on; it can also spread from wild onions if they are growing near an onion garden. White bulb rot disease is most common and serious in onions being grown in light, cool, wet soil. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant onion types that are resistan to diseases (advice on these can be got from agricultural personnel) and they should also plant healthy seeds.

Onion bulbs (the onions that have developed on a plant) may also be attacked, mainly at the neck and signs of this are yellowish to reddish watery rotting parts.\nPREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should practice early planting and when planting they should use seeds of onion types that have waxy leaves since they are more resistant to disease than onion types that have glossy (smooth and shiny) leaves. Farmers should also increase the amount of ploughing they do between seasons since this helps reduce purple blotch disease, spacing left between onion plants should also be increased. Other good practices farmers can carry out to prevent purple blotch disease in onions include treating seeds before they are planted, carrying out crop rotation, removing remains of onions plants after harvest and planting onions in soil that is well drained.  If the disease has greatly attacked a big onion garden then farmers may be advised to spray their onion plants with fungicides (advice must be got from agricultural personnel in the area on which fungicide to use and how to use it).

They attack groundnuts at all stages of growth eating roots and damaging the groundnut pods; they also eat the ends of the main roots and other roots and the affected groundnut plants may later on start rotting. White grubs also cut groundnut pods off the groundnut plant and destroy larger, soft pods. White grubs are common in soil that has alot of organic matter (new fields that have been opened up or gardens where alot of manure is kept or applied). SIGNS: Farmers will usually be able to see the white grubs in the soil around the lower stems of groundnut plants. Affected plants will start drying up and later on die; when these plants are pulled out of the ground they will have roots that are eaten and the groundnut pods will also be eaten. White grubs also usually attack groundnuts following the rows in which the plants were planted. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should leave enough time between the time they apply manure in the garden and when they plant groundnuts; they should also avoid applying too much manure in a garden especially in the planting season because this may increase chances of white grubs attacking the groundnuts. Carrying out deep ploughing or using a hoe to dig up soil will expose the grubs in the soil and help to kill them which reduces their numbers and the damage they cause to groundnut crops.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Leafminers Leaves losing green color and having white lines on them leaves young leaves dying","id":"a0r70000000StjbAAC","content":"This is caused by pests called leaf miners. The young ones of leaf miners make small holes through which they enter the groundnut leaves and they feed on the inner parts of the leaf which makes affected leaves develop white or yellowish lines, lose green color as well as the normal leaf shape. When the young ones of leaf miners become big, they come out of the leaf and pull leaves together using threads and this becomes its home on the plant. Serious attacks of leaf miners can leave groundnut crops looking as if they are burnt and there can be heavy losses at harvest.  SIGNS: Leaves on affected plants develop white lines (mines) in them, lose green color along the areas where the leaf miners are feeding and the leaves die when they are still young. Affected groundnut plants will start having leaves that are bent and stuck together using webs and there will be insects living inside these leaves. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types (like Egola 1) that are resistant against leaf miner attacks. Groundnuts should be planted during the first rains because leaf miners are usually few at this time. During dry periods, groundnut crops should be irrigated  because plants that are not getting enough water are more likely to be affected by leaf miners.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StXMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Millipedes Groundnut plants growing slower than normal young pods being eaten and presence of many millipedes in the garden","id":"a0r70000000StjcAAC","content":"Millipedes are a major pest of groundnuts in Uganda; millipedes are brown or black in color and they curl when they are disturbed.

Millipedes also damage flowers on groundnut plants. SIGNS: Farmers will be able to see millipedes moving on the soil in groundnut gardens. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep their groundnut gardens clean (by regularly removing weeds as well as parts of plant that fall down).

insects that can be seen on affected groundnut plants collecting together on young parts of the plants (like on new leaves). While aphids are feeding on groundnut plants they can spread diseases (like groundnut rosette disease) and they also reduce the amount of yield that can be harvested especially if they attack during the dry season. SIGNS: Groups of small dark insects collected in groups on young parts of groundnut plants is a sign that aphids have attacked. Young leaves under shich aphids are hiding may also become curled (roll up) but farmers will be able  to see the aphids if they open up these leaves. Another sign of aphids is if groundnut plants are growing slower than normal and if their leaves and stems lose their normal shape. Presence of many ants on the groundnut plants is also a sign that groundnut crops are affected by aphids. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should plant groundnut types that can withstand aphids (groundnut types Nyanda, Serenut 2 and Igora 1). Farmers should also carry out early planting and avoid leaving wide spaces between groundnut plants; early planting (planting when the rains have just begun) helps groundnuts to grow up quickly and flower before aphids attack while using the correct spacing between groundnut plants (not leaving very wide spaces between them) prevents aphids from coming into the garden coming from the edges of the garden, it prevents numbers of aphids from increasing in the garden and prevents groundnut diseases spread by aphids from breaking out in the groundnuts being grown.

Groundnut pods experiencing a serious attack of the disease will be completely covered with white things (fungus) and will later on rot. In some cases, seeds from pods infected with groundnut blight will have a blue greyish color. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Gardens in which groundnuts are to be planted should be ploughed deeply. Farmers should keep their gardens clean by removing and burning remains of plants affected by groundnut blight and burying crop remains in the soil after harvesting is done.

Crown rot disease also produces poisonous substances in groundnut seeds that can cause death or other signs of poisoning in animals or people that eat infected seeds (this poisonousness is more serious in stored groundnuts than in growing groundnuts). SIGNS: Branches on affected groundnut plants dry up permanently and the dead and dry branches are easy to remove from the rest of the plant; the whole plant may dry up too. Infected groundnut pods will also have spots of black things that look like soot. The branches or the entire plant wilts  permanently and the dead and dried branches are easily detached from the collar region. Infected pods reveal patches of black covered spores. When infected groundnut seeds are removed from the soil they will be covered with black things that look like soot. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should be careful not to cause any damage to groundnut pods during harvesting because this can be a starting point for crown rot disease to attack groundnut seeds inside the pods. Groundnuts should be properly dried before they are stored to prevent poisonous substances from developing in the stored groundnut seeds.

In dry and hot areas, mushroom houses should be built under trees to get enough shade and protection from direct sunlight and this helps keep temperatures inside the house cool. Materials that can be used when building a house for mushroom growing include: bricks, mud, wood and grass (for thatching the roof). Grass thatching is preferred becaue it keeps a mushroom house cooler inside better than ironsheet roofs can; if an ironsheet roofed house is used then grass should be spread out on the ironsheet roof to help keep the insides of the house cool.

The earliest sign that vanilla pods are becoming mature is a yellow colour developing on their top ends; the yellow colour spreads all over the vanilla pods and their tips turn brown (when these signs are seen farmers should start harvesting). In Uganda, vanilla harvesting is usually done around July and August (this is the main season) and also around December and January (this is the second season). The vanilla harvesting process usually takes between 2 and 3 months during which farmers should walk through the garden frequently picking the ripe vanilla pods. harvest is spread over a period of 2 to 3 months.

In Thika these take 25-28 months to come into bearing, but have uniform growth and are less susceptible to to premature fruiting. Slips; These are leafy shoot growth arising from the fruit stalks, they take 22-24 months to come into bearing. Suckers; They are leafy shoot growth from the base of the plant where the roots grow. They give the highest yield, but have a long harvest duration. They are also more difficult to plant. Suckers take 18-22 months to come into bearing. To achieve uniform plant growth, selection and sizing of planting material is of major importance. All planting material can be stored upside down in the shade for up to three months and then planted in loose friable dry or preirrigated soil. Only totally healthy and if possible large shoots should be chosen, in order to ensure a uniform crop. Slips can also tolerate dryness, yet not as well as the suckers as they are generally lighter in weight. Slips vary much in size making grading in sizes necessary in order to have uniform plantings. Planting is normally done at the beginning of the long rains. As soon as the plantation begins to produce fruit, any harvested plants should be removed and cut up before being spread over the soil. The plantation will also need to be thinned out from time to time, because suckers, which continually develop, may limit the amount of room available for each individual plant. When all possible niches are already occupied with plants, weeds will have little chance of gaining a foothold, and can also easily be uprooted by hand. Mature weeds can be cut down with a knife or pulled out and then cut up to be used for mulch material. One preventative measure is to sow non-climbing legumes before the pineapples are planted\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Land preparation","id":"a0r70000000StcoAAC","content":"Pineapples perform best in open sunshine areas; therefore the land must be cleared of all trees, shrubs and bushes.

Proper land preparation is extremely important for the development of the roots. Poor land preparation result in poor yields. Perennial weeds should be cleared by repeated deep cultivations during the dry season. Uproot weeds, allow them to dry, harrow into strips and burn them. In areas where the soils have high clay content, it is essential to plough also during the dry season to facilitate root penetration of pineapples. Plough to a depth of 45 cm, or if using hand digging, dig as deep as possible. After ploughing, use a disc harrow to produce a fine tilth. Small-scale growers can uproot old pineapple plants by hand, while large growers can use a large harrow to uproot and chop the stumps and leaves. Nitrogen is essential to the increase of fruit size and total yield. Five to 10 tons of manure per hectare applied to the field before mulching and planting will increase eventual yields. A general application of 180 to 200 kg/ ha of rock phosphate should be added at the same time. Each ratoon crop will again need a new supply of nutrients and will benefit from compost as well as rock phosphate at the same rate. To avoid infection by dry-rot fungus  all of the shoots should be stored in a shady place for wounds to heal and suberise quickly.

SIGNS: Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by early leaf spot will have dark brown spots surrounded by a yellow circle (the spots will be light brown on the lower side of leaves). Leaves of groundnut plants attacked by late leaf spot will have darkers spots with no (or a very light) yellow circle surrounding them; strong attacks of late leaf spot will make leaves fall off the groundnut plant which makes it grow old before the right time.

Farmers should also plough or harrow fields before they transplant tomatoes into them since this helps dry up and kill the cutworms, exposes them to other animals or insects which feed on them and it also helps destroy plant remains in which cutworms hide at times. Farmers can control cutworms by making barriers to protect transplanted seedlings (Barriers can be made by wrapping paper, thin cardboard or similar materials around the base of transplant stems.Toilet rolls can also be used as cutworm collars since they are readily available and can easily be absorbed into soil later on). Other forms of control include keeping natural enemies of cutworms in the garden (for example ants which feed on cutworms) and digging near damaged stems to destroy the cutworms.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVVAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"White Leathery Areas On Fruits","id":"a0r70000000StdFAAS","content":"If the fruit of tomatoes has white leathery areas, it is likely it has been burnt by the sun.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVVAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Purplish Leaves","id":"a0r70000000StdGAAS","content":"If tomato leaves generally appear purple with purple veins,  and have been growing in cool temperatures and there is no evidence of insects, then it is likely plant is lacking phosphorus.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVXAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StdHAAS","content":"Tomatoes should never be intercroped with irish potatoes or members of the cabbage family.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:12\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StVXAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed Management","id":"a0r70000000StdIAAS","content":"Manage weeds to reduce on yield loses resulting from weed competition, pests and diseases that they harbor.

It is not good to plant simsim on soil that is sloping because it can easily be washed away by water when it rains. Simsim should also not be planted in very windy places or places that have soil that develops a hard layer when rain falls heavily. Simsim should be planted in areas that receive enough evenly distributed rainfall (between 400 to 500 mm) throughout the growing season.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast

This means farmers should plan carefully according to the locations of their tree plantations. Firebreaks can be made either manually (clearing vegetation through digging and slashing to ground level) or through controlled burning. Manual clearing is expensive and is not recommended on steep slopes as it will lead to erosion. Controlled burning is usually the best method of preparing firebreaks and it should be carried out when the sorrounding vegetation is still green. When carrying out controlled burning, a useful technique is to spray a line of Glyphosate which is 1 metre wide on either side of the firebreak to be made (this spraying should be done when the firebreak and sorrounding vegetation is still green). As soon as the sprayed lines have dried, vegetation in the sprayed lines can be burnt off safely. Once the vegetation found in between the sprayed lines has dried off naturally it can also be burnt off since the cleared lines on either side prevent the fire from spreading to other places. Whenever controlled burning is being done people should be ready with fire fighting equipment in case conditions change or the fire jumps to another area. Farmers should also never carry out any burning when conditions are dangerous (when it is too hot or vegetation around is too dry). In areas where vegetation does not dry off naturally, firebreaks can be made by slashing vegetation but the slashing should be done as close to the ground as possible.The slashed vegetation should be left to dry and then it should be collected in the middle of the firebreak and it should be burnt when it is safe to burn and before the fire season starts.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:32\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sts9AAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"filling","id":"a0r70000000StsMAAS","content":"Cotton will germinate in 7 to 10 days.

The ties should be checked frequently for the first couple of years to ensure that growth of the tree trunk or stem has not caused them to become too tight.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO,NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYoAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Golden Rosette","id":"a0r70000000StmuAAC","content":"Under good orchard management variety, Golden Dorset produces 400 fruits per tree per year and this makes a farmer earn Shs200, 000 per tree per year assuming that the cost of each fruit is sh.500.

Farmers that can afford can buy complete feed fomrmulations or commercial feeds during dry periods.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding from the middle up to the end of the milking season","id":"a0r70000000StPnAAK","content":"About half way through the milking season, the amount of milk produced by cows may start reducing. At this stage dairy farmers should add supplements to the feeds being given to cattle depending on the quality and amount of forage (grasses) which is available.

Usually cows will produce about 5 kg of milk if they are being fed on good quality alone; for every 1 kg of concentrate fed cows should produce between 1 or 1 and a half kg of milk more than the usual 5 kg of milk that are produced when cows are being fed on forage (grasses) alone.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding from the start up to the middle of the milking season","id":"a0r70000000StPoAAK","content":"Early in the milking season, cows should be fed on a lot of good quality forage (like young, dark green elephant grass). A cow being fed on good quality forage can produce between 7 and 10 kg of milk each day without being given additional mixed feeds (concentrates). Large breeds of cows (like Fresians) can eat more than 100 kg of forage during the rainy season and between 70 and 80 kg during the dry season. Smaller breeds (like Jersey) can eat 65 to 85 kg of forage during the rainy season and between 55 and 65 kg during the dry season. For cows to keep producing high amounts of milk (especially after they have given birth) they should be given 4 kg of dairy meal each day and this amount of dairy feed should be increased by 1 or half a kg each day if the cow responds by increasing the amount of milk she is producing; when the amount of concetrates being given reaches 14 kg the farmer maintain it at that amount until the amount of milk being produced by the cow starts reducing. Dairy farmers that are cannot continuously feed their cattle on concentrates should provide only 8 kg of concentrate per day for the first 12 weeks of the milking season and then just good quality forages alone afterwards, rather than to feed 2 kg per day for the whole milking period. This will result in a higher yield over the full milking season. If the cow is not already used to concentrates, then after it gives birth farmers should start by giving it just 2 kg per day and increase gradually over the first week to 8 kg per day.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StFZAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to make and use the pesticide in powder form","id":"a0r70000000StFlAAK","content":"Mix two handfuls of tephrosia leaves, two handfuls of marigold leaves, 8 leaves of tobacco, two handfuls of Phytolacca dodecandra leaves.

In addition to the plenty of pasture, calves at this age should be given between 1 and 2 kg of mixed feeds per day (mixed feeds are factory made food for animals that can be got from shops selling animal feeds); if farmers cannot provide mixed feeds then they should increase the amount of legumes they are giving the calves.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNLAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General calf management","id":"a0r70000000StPzAAK","content":"It is important to provide a lot of care for the calves since they are easily affected by diseases and problems that come from calves not getting enough nutrients. Farmers should provide clean, dry, well ventilated housing for calves and provide enough bedding (dry soft grass) which should be regularly changed.

There are cases where the hind feet show first when a calf is being born (this will be seen if the feet appear upside down as they come out); and when this happens the farmer will need to give help to the cow as it gives birth. When the hind legs show first, the farmer should wait until the feet have come out from the cow’s vulva and then they should start pulling the legs gently at the same time as the cow pushes (the person pulling should first wait and feel the cow pushing then they should gently pull the calf out; they should stop pulling when the cow stops pushing and carry on pulling when it starts pushing again). Once the hind quarter of the calf is out (and only the upper part is left inside the cow) farmers should make sure that the calf gets out quickly. Other abnormal ways in which a calf being born may come out of the cow include the tail showing first, twisted neck, one leg showing first and the farmer should quickly get help from a veterinary doctor in such any of these cases occur.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of a cow about to give birth","id":"a0r70000000StQ1AAK","content":"Between 1 and 2 weeks before giving birth, the cow's vulva swells, the udder becomes large, firm, full and may start producing a thick milky substance. On the day of giving birth, the cow separates itself from the rest of the herd, holds its tail high and off the vulva opening, becomes restless and a clear mucus substance may begin to flow from the vulva. At the actual time of giving birth, the water sac which contains the unborn calf appears and the front feet of the calf appear after the water sac breaks.  During the process of giving birth the cow should be left to produce the calf on its own for atleast 12 hours before farmers come in to try and offer any help.  When the calf is born farmers should remove the mucus from the mouth and nostrils of the calf and let the mother of the calf lick the mucus from the rest of the calf's body. The calf's umbilical chord should be cut with a sharp, clean (preferably new) blade and then it should be dipped in iodine solution (this can be got from an animal clinic). If the newborn calf is having difficulty in breathing then the farmer should scratch its nose using a dry piece of grass, hold its hind legs and swing it gently forward and backward or pour cold water on its nose to make it sneeze.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:52\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StNMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparing for birth of calves","id":"a0r70000000StQ2AAK","content":"The gestation period of a cow will last between 274 and 291 days (9 months).

At the entrance of the dip tank a foot bath helps to remove soil from the feet of the animals so that it does not contaminate the chemical in the dip tank. Foot baths are also put at the gate of the farm for visitors entering the farm to disinfect their feet before entering the farm; foot baths help to kill parasites and disease causing organisms that the animals or visitors may be caring on their feet. Use of foot baths also helps to control foot rot by killing the bacteria that cattle may have on their feet. Foot baths should be at least 2 metres in length and 0.15 metres deep.

With loose housing, cows may need to be tied up in stalls and should give birth far away from the milking area and close to the area where calves are kept. The area in which cows give birth should be easy to clean and disinfect thoroughly. There should be one calving stall for every 30 stalls with a minimum of 2;\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Coccidiosis can kill a large number of chicken before it is identified (this means the disease can attack and kill birds before showing any major signs). Coccidiosis is common in chicken that are being kept under a deep litter system and when the disease breaks out it usually spreads quickly (because birds are always in contact with litter which may have droppings that have the disease) so farmers must do all they can to prevent the disease from breaking out. SIGNS: Affected chicken lose appetite and look dull and weak; sometimes the chicken may also pass out blood stained droppings. The disease also causes a high number of deaths in young chicken and when dead birds are cut open their intestines will be swollen. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure chicks, feed and water are kept away from chicken droppings; chicken should not be overcrowded in the house in which they are being kept. Litter used in the chicken house should be kept dry, turned regularly and any wet areas in it should be removed and replaced with dry litter. If coccidiosis breaks out farmers must immediately remove birds that show signs of the disease and should start treating them immediately. There are drugs (called anticoccidials or coccidiostats) that farmers can mix in chicken feeds to help reduce levels of infection when coccidiocis breaks out (chicken that are to be slaughtered should not be given these drugs atleast 4 days before they are killed to  avoid drugs staying inside the carcass). Chicken with coccidiocis can also be treated by giving them drinking water in which Amprollium has been mixed (farmers MUST always seek advice from veterinary personnel on which drugs to use, amounts to use and how to mix the drugs).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StP1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Vaccination","id":"a0r70000000StP2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:51\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StMJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Keeping records of chicken","id":"a0r70000000StP3AAK","content":"It is very important for farmers to keep information on the broiler chicken they are keeping; this is called record keeping.

Farmers should turn the litter regularly (using a hoe, shovel or garden rake) so that it remains dry and does not become hard (it should be easy to break up into small bits when it is held in the hands). If litter in a chicken house is not looked after well it will develop a hard surface layer which can give broilers problems like breast blisters (when the birds rest down on hard litter the area around their breasts is bruised and develops wounds which later become hard; this lowers the quality of meat got from the broilers.

can also be fed using using buckets; bucket feeding helps farmers to control the amount of milk calves are taking each day (which prevents diseases like scours) and is also helpful when a cow dies and leaves calves behind.  It may not be easy to train calves how to drink from a bucket so it is important to start early. The first few days of bucket feeding are the most important so farmers should make sure that the calf gets enough milk at this time. Bucket feeding should be started when calves are between 2 to 3 days old. Farmers should keep weighing calves because this helps them know how much milk to give the calves at different stages. In the first 2 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/10 of their body weight and feeding should be done 3 times a day. In the next 3 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/5 of their body weight and feeding should be done 2 times a day. After 5 weeks, calves should be given milk that is equal to 1/20 of their body weight until they are weaned and feeding should be done 2 times a day. Calves should be fed at the same time each day and milk should be given to calves immediately after it has been milked.\n\nAttribution: Department of Animal Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Makerere University\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:15:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su9lAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Animal advice","id":"a0r70000000Su0SAAS","content":"Moses Tella Chemusto 0779465546.

Harvesting too early or too late may result in yield loss.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NRI, CIP, NARO, FAO, CPP, DFID\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StU9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StUAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StUBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StUCAA0","content":"Sweet potatoes are perennial vines, The roots are eaten either boiled or roasted alone or with other foods such as milk, porridge, soups or meat. Young leaves are used as vegetable. The sweet potato vines are a useful and nutritious fodder crop, especially in the dry season. The crop is grown on well-drained, sandy loam with a clayey sub soil to avoid water logging sweet potatoes are usually grown on mounds or ridges. Flooding before harvest result in rotting of tubers  in the soil or during subsequent storage. Sweet potato grows best and produces smooth, well-shaped storage roots in a well-prepared soil. Good land or soil preparation involves removal or incorporation of crop debris and any vegetation that may compete with the sweet potato crop, and deep manual or mechanical cultivation. Cultivation turns over the topsoil, loosens compacted soil below, to achieve a good tilth for forming the hills or ridges, and provide a soft, uniform medium where storage root growth is not impeded hence plow and harrow thoroughly.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NRI, CIP, NARO, FAO, CPP, DFID\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"High fever shivering and trembling diarrhoea rapid bloat decomposing of the carcass blood appears at the natural openings nose or anus","id":"a0r70000000StI3AAK","content":"(Miltsiekte) The disease is called Anthrax causes acute death without any symptoms.

Male rabbits have a small upwards swelling while female rabbits have a small opening. The process of sexing is easier to do by two people with one holding the rabbit while the other person finds out the sex of the rabbit. Young rabbits usually lie very still when laid on their backs.

Farmers should also deworm young rabbits 1 week after weaning them (deworming can be done with 1/4ml of Albendazole administered by mouth with a small syringe (without needle)for each 1 month old rabbit). When deworming the syringe should not be pushed too far into the rabbits mouth since this may damage their throats.

NOTE that pineapples are low in sugar content and unripe pineapples do not ripen after harvest. Generally the fruits are mature and ready for harvest when they snap off at the bending of the fruit and these can be stored/ transported to distant markets. Fresh fruits destined for the local market are plucked when almost ripe while those destined for export are harvested when beginning to turn yellow-green at the fruit base. They are cut off with a sharp knife, leaving a stem which is later trimmed to 3.4cm. Some times ripeness and quality can be judged by snapping a finger against the side of the fruit. A good, ripe fruit gives a dull, solid sound while immaturity and poor quality fruits give a hollow knock. Harvested fruits can be stored up to 4-6 weeks at 7°C. NEVER bruise fruits as this will cause rotting and lower quality. The pineapple plants usually produce for about four years.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Growth Disorders","id":"a0r70000000StVMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StVNAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRxAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StVOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:29\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRyAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"For more Information","id":"a0r70000000StVPAA0","content":"For more information on improved varieties, contact National Agricultural Research Organisation(NARO), National Crops Resesources Research Institute_Namulonge.

The holes in which seedlings are planted should not be completely filled with soil but a small space should be left to collect rain water. When planting  create a hole in the soil to insert the boll of soil held by the plant roots from the pot (NEVER plant seedlings with the polythene bags still attached to them (remove the polythene pots) AND if planting by grafting  the point of grafting/union should be well above ground  not covered by soil or mulch or since this can lead to diseases like collar rot and other diseases or pests spread by soil contact). The planting holes must be deep enough to cover all the root area of the seedlings. Tie a string on each seedling and attach the string to the wire used to connect support poles in a row (this helps to harness the plants to the wire).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Fertiliser application","id":"a0r70000000StgRAAS","content":"Passion fruits need to grow fast to reach the wires attached to the support poles. The rate at which passion fruits grow and the amount of yield harvested depend on how fertile the soil is. Farmers can improve soil fertility by adding fertilisers and the best fertilisers to add is organic manure (like cow dung  compost  chicken liter). Farmers can repeatedly add fertiliser to soil after harvesting to help restore nutrients that have been lost from the soil  nutrients that have been used up by the passion fruit trees and to increase the speed at which young branches grow since these young branches later on produce fruit. Adding manure to soil in passion fruit gardens also helps to control the effect of viruses on the growth of passion fruits (Since plants have a high level of nutrition they wont be strongly affected by virus attacks). Passion fruit flowers may die if the soil does not have enough potassium and farmers can avoid this by adding manure to the soil. Adding manure to soil also increases soil's ability to hold moisture and promotes continuous growth in plants. Inorganic fertilizers such as NPK (17:17:17)  NPK (10:5:20  at 1.36 kg per plant 4 times a year) and Murate can also be used (get instructions from stockists on how to use these fertilisers). NPK increases growth of new shoots and fruit quality while Murate of potash will also improve fruit quality.Application of 0.9 to 1kg of nitrogen results into 30 kg of fruits  but excessive nitrogen will cause passion fruits to fall off trees before they are fully grown. Passion fruit vines should always be watched for deficiencies  particularly in potassium and calcium.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Watering","id":"a0r70000000StgSAAS","content":"Farmers should water passion fruit regularly to keep a vines flowering and fruiting almost continuously.

Pruning also helps to expose pests to their enemies like predators  and to unfavorable conditions like strong sunshine  rain and wind  it helps to disentangle the holdings of the tendrils so that each of the branches hangs on its own for ease of management and pruning  helps to ensure that important parts of the plant get enough nutrients which helps these parts to produce big high quality marketable fruits. Ensure that only one shoot is led to the support wire. When pruning  allow the terminal shoot to grow above the support wire by about 10 cm  and then cut off the bud. This will stimulate production of lateral branches and the farmer should select only two of them and try making each one to grow towards the pole. As they grow along the wire attached to the support poles  they will also produce other branches. These branches should be helped to hang by disentangling the holdings of the tendrils. If this is not done  the branches will tie up resulting in poor exposure of leaves to sunshine  poor exposure of flowers to pollinators  raising temperatures of the plant that may start the out break of brown spot disease and makes pruning difficult. ALWAYS disinfect tools every after pruning a plant to prevent disease spread from one plant to another. Dip tools in JIK after working on each plant  heat tools in flame or use alcohol methanol to clean them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWRAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Weed control","id":"a0r70000000StgWAAS","content":"Weeds are dangerous to passion fruits since they harbor pests and diseases  compete with plants for nutrients leading to low yields. Removing weeds from passion fruits helps eliminate hosts of mites and other passion fruit pests (like mites  aphids  white flies and thrips)  lowers competition for nutrients and water  eliminates risk of diverting away beneficial insects (like bees which help pollinate passion fruits). Removing weeds also eases general crop management  eliminates risk of fire in dry weeds  lowers risk of rats and rodent attacks. Farmers can control weeds in passion fruits by ring hoeing around the passion fruit plants (the circle dug around the passion fruit plant should be 1.5 m in diameter) and slashing the rest of the area or by spraying herbicides (herbicides should be sprayed away from passion fruit plants and they should be applied in a manner that wind does not blow herbicide to the passion fruits). Farmers should only apply herbicides like Propanil that will only kill weed parts in contact or Butachlor and 2 4-D that will kill whole weed plants after single point contact. Farmers should be careful when removing weeds from passion fruit gardens since injuries to the base of the vines may allow entrance of disease causing organisms. Damaging passion fruit vines during weeding can be avoided by hand weeding or the application of herbicides around the main passion fruit stems (these practices will also protect passion fruit roots which are shallow and can easily be damaged).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30

Farmers should also keep water sources clean and keep the environment clean to prevent pigs from being attacked by diseases.

The waste collected from pig houses can be applied in crop gardens and when placed in the garden the pig waste should be covered with a layer of soil to avoid loss of nutrients, bad smells and gathering of flies. Farmers should make a pit into which pig wastes are emptied on a daily basis and it should be close to the pig house to reduce labour requirement. The pit made can be a concrete pit or a simple earth pit and it should be covered. The pit is emptied at different times depending on the capacity of waste it can hold.

Most pig farmers in Uganda do not carry weaning early because it requires an expensive diet for the piglets and needs farmers to provide alot of care. The best way to do this may be by removing the mother from the pig house and leaving piglets in an area they are used to for some time. Weaning should be done slowly over a 4 day period by reducing food given to the female pig each day to just 3 kg since this will help to make it stop producing milk for the piglets. Farmers can also practice split weaning and this is done by removing all piglets that are above average size from the litter at the end of the 5th week and allowing small piglets to suckle for an extra 4 to 5 days.

Female pigs can sometimes identify their own piglets from others using their smell and they may use this to refuse other piglets given to them which are not their own; to avoid this, farmers piglets should try hiding the smell of the piglets so that the mother cannot identify its young and this can be done by smearing all the piglets including her own piglets with a strong smelling substance like iodine or soaking all the piglets thoroughly in a salt solution.

This disease does not infect the root system of pigeon pea plants and is spread by a fungus which is found in the soil and can survive in the remains of infected crop debris. Control:  Farmers should plant pigeon peas in fields which are known not to have heard any previous case of blight. Farmers should not plant in fields which are likely to be affected by water logging and should leave wide spaces between rows when planting pigeon peas.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWWAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small pin shaped spots with light grey centres surrounded by brown margins rotten and torn roots","id":"a0r70000000StgfAAC","content":"This disease is called stem canker and it forms small pin shaped spots with grey centres which are sorrounded by brown margins. The centers of the spots have scattered dots. The spots join up and cause branches or whole plants to dry up and die. Pigeon pea plants which are affected will suddenly wilt and if they are uprooted their roots will be rotten and torn. The disease mainly attacks secondary finer roots which develop dark blackened lines and dots underneath their barks. Stem canker disease can be a serious problem in areas where pigeon peas are grown season after season or where planting is done late. Control: Farmers should plant pigeon pea types which are resistant to diseases and they should also plant in fields which have no history of being affected by stem canker disease.

Inner parts of pigeon pea plants will be brown or black when the main stem or primary branches are split. Gardens which are attacked by fusarium wilt will have patches of dead plants. The fungus which causes fusarium wilt can survive on infected crop debris in the soil for about 3 years. Control: Farmers should plant pigeon pea seeds which are clean, free from diseases and are resistant to fusarium wilt and grow well when planted. Farmers should also plant pigeon peas in gardens which have had no case of fusarium wilt in the past 3 years.

Adult blister beetles are medieum to large sized (between 2 to 5 cm in length). The adults are medium to large sized beetles (2 to 5 cm in length) which are usually black and yellow or black and red in colour. Control: Farmers should remove adult beetles from pigeon pea plants using their hands (care should be taken when doing this since these beetles can damage the skin). Farmers can also use oils got from eucalyptus and clay powder to chase away beetles from pigeon pea plants.

Signs of attack include round holes from which the bruchids come out after feeding on pigeon pea seeds and white eggs which can be seen on surfaces of pigeon pea seeds. Bruchids can cause very high losses in pigeon peas after harvesting if the farmer does not try to control them. Control:  Farmers should harvest pigeon pea pods as soon as they mature and pigeon pea seeds should be dried in the sun before they are stored (and they should be stored in clean containers which cannot allow beetles to enter). Farmers can also cover pigeon pea seeds with a layer of edible oil (cooking oil) or clean, undisturbed clay (inert clay) to prevent further development of bruchids in stored seeds. Another way to keep away bruchids is by mixing wood ash in pigeon pea seeds stored for food or planting (seeds for planting can also be protected by mixing them with chillies or exposing them to smoke from cooking fires).

However nitrogen fertilizer tends to reduce oil percentage of the seed  change the amino acid balance  and increase leaf area of the plant. Yield increases when up to 80kg/acre of Nitrogen fertilizer are applied. Nitrogen recommendations in dryer regions can be made from estimates of nitrate nitrogen in the soil (contact NARO for soils analysis). In the wetter regions recommendations are based upon soil organic matter and previous crop history  and it is recommended to apply 8kg Nitrogen /acre after fallow  27kg Nitrogen /acre after small grain and 36 to 45kg Nitrogen /acre after corn. On higher organic matter soils  amounts should be lowered. Nitrogen can be supplied from mineral or non-mineral sources (manures and legume stover  compost). Row placement of Phosphorus and potassium may be important in sunflower for maximizing efficiency of fertilizer use  as it is with many species. Recommendations for applications of Phosphorus and potassium should be made from soil tests and the yield goal for each field. Apply extra phosphorus and potassium when the flower bud begins to develop  to promote bigger blooms. Recommendations range from 18 to 32kg/acre P2O5 and 27 to 64kg/acre K2O for soils testing very low in Phosphorus or potassium  depending on soil yield potential. These recommendations decrease as soil test Phosphorus and/or potassium increase. Response to Phosphorus is not expected if soil Phosphorus exceeds 13kg/acre nor to potassium if the potassium tests is greater than 136kg/acre.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWbAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Intercropping","id":"a0r70000000StguAAC","content":"Sunflower can be grown as a pure stand but can also be intercroped with other anuals especially legumes (Beans  Soya beans).\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWcAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Birds","id":"a0r70000000StgvAAC","content":"One of the most serious constraints to sunflower production in Uganda is birds.

The first symptom is usually drying of young trees starting from the new shoots going down, eventually the whole tree dries up and dies. Another sign is trees having the root collar or bark of trees found at or just below ground level eaten up and when the affected tree is pulled up many of the tree's roots will also have been eaten. Ways of controlling termites include using healthy and vigorous seedlings when planting, planting early in the rainy season, ensuring seedlings are watered well immediately before planting out, planting eucalyptus types which are resistant to termites and mixing dusban with nursery soil or putting it into planting holes when planting. Farmers can also control termites by spraying using insecticides like chlorpyrifos, isofenphos, permethrin, carbofuran, carbosulfan and decamethrin. Another way to control termites is by destroying their mound, removing the queen and spraying them with insecticide. FARMERS SHOULD BE VERY CAREFUL when using pesticides since many of them are poisonous. Farmers should get advice from agricultural personnel before using any pesticide and anyone spraying the pesticide should wear protective gear and handle the chemical carefully.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StX0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Small black insects with transparent wings causing abnormal outgrowths on leaves and deformed shoots","id":"a0r70000000Sti9AAC","content":"These pests are called blue gum chalcids and they are very small black insects with transparent wings which lay their eggs in leaves, leaf stalks and stems of eucalyptus trees.

Land clearing usually leaves alot of plant material lying around and the best way to clear it is by having a controlled, cool burn. Burning will be more successful if the cleared vegetation has been left to dry after it is cut and if the cleared material is collected into piles rather than being scattered through out the whole area. Farmers should be careful to burn cleared vegetation when conditions are favourable (do not burn on windy days and have enough people with fire fighting equipment ready so that they can put out the incase it becomes uncontrolled.)\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Luweero","id":"a0r70000000Su5yAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4MAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buikwe","id":"a0r70000000Su5zAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nwoya","id":"a0r70000000Su60AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su61AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su62AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rubirizi","id":"a0r70000000Su63AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mitooma","id":"a0r70000000Su64AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Buhweju","id":"a0r70000000Su65AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sheema","id":"a0r70000000Su66AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pader","id":"a0r70000000Su67AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4OAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bushenyi","id":"a0r70000000Su68AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kitgum","id":"a0r70000000Su69AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4NAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Agago","id":"a0r70000000Su6AAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Mukono","id":"a0r70000000Su6BAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4PAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nakaseke","id":"a0r70000000Su6CAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000Su6DAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4RAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Oyam","id":"a0r70000000Su6EAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Su4QAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000Su6FAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:26:31\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Choosing the right seeds","id":"a0r70000000StlsAAC","content":"You choose the type of seeds to plant by considering the seeds' resistance to diseases and hard weather conditions like drought and heavy rains, how long they take to mature, how much buyers like them, the climate of your area and how much yield the seeds can give.Farmers growing beans to feed the family may prefer bean types that cook faster while a farmer growing beans for sale may plant bean types that are on high demand in the market.

After pruning one plant farmers must clean pruning knives before they use them on other plants since bacterial canker can be spread by pruning knives. Farmers should also avoid doing any work in a tomato garden when it is wet.\n\nAttribution: Information by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StYJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Damaged flowers and bolls","id":"a0r70000000Stm7AAC","content":"Bollworms damage flowers and cotton fruits.

Farmers should observe their pigs daily for signs of disease, should keep close contact with veterinary personnel for guidance and they should report any signs of disease as early as possible so that veterinary personnel can quickly determine which disease is affecting the pigs and apply appropriate control measures.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MAAIF, NARO, NAADS,MAK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Parasites","id":"a0r70000000StHcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StHdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StHeAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rearing and care","id":"a0r70000000StHfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StGEAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General management","id":"a0r70000000StHgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preservation of Skins","id":"a0r70000000StHhAAK","content":"After slaughter or death  the sale of semi-processed hides and skins forms a valuable source of income both local and foreign exchange. Tanning skins and manufacturing leather products adds 5 to 10 times value to the skins. In hot humid conditions skin rotting occurs quickly and spoils the skin. \nThe first stage in the preservation of fresh skins is known as curing and there are 2 simple methods of skin curing. \n1.  Air-drying: - The wet skin is either  pegged out on the ground or tied to a frame and dried upright. It is important to avoid any damage to the skin and to try not to spoil the edges through clumsy pegging or tying. In climates that are not too humid  skins can be cured in 1-2 days. \n2. Salt Curing: - The fresh skin is cleaned of any blood or dirt  and washed with clean water. It is laid out with the inside facing upwards. Salt equivalent to 40 % of its weight is sprinkled on to it  until it is covered in an even layer. The salt will serve both to reduce its water content and to prevent bacterial development. The skin can be folded with the salted side inside and kept in this way for long periods before tanning. \n3. The advanced form of skin processing is leather tanning. There are different types of leather that can be produce from goatskins. Vegetable tanned leather: this has the most potential for rural area tanning. Book binding leather, Clothing leather,  Glove type of leather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet/Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preservation of meat","id":"a0r70000000StHiAAK","content":"Goats that are slaughtered are consumed immediately.

Other ways farmers can control black rot is by removing  burning  or deep ploughing all cabbage crop remains immediately after harvest to reduce the ability of black rot causing bacteria to survive in the soil where there is no crop. Growing cabbage on raised beds with mulching also helps eliminate conditions that favour development of black rot disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWDAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish spots on upper leaf surface","id":"a0r70000000StfqAAC","content":"This cabbage disease is called white rust.

Farmers should avoid harvesting cabbages in warm  wet conditions since this favours development of the disease. Black rot disease may attack cabbages still in the garden but it is more serious in cabbages which are stored. The bacteria which causes soft rot is spread in cabbage gardens by water splashes or contact with garden tools like hoes and knives. Signs of the disease include infected cabbage heads becoming soft  watery and at times rotting completely. The affected area on cabbages become soft  mushy and generally turn dark in colour. First signs of bacterial soft rot are an initial infection on the outer leafstalks of cabbages which are in contact with the soil  and the infection spreads to the cabbage heads. Soft rot infection in cabbages almost always emits a bad smell and eventually cabbage leaves  sterns and roots are entirely decayed. Farmers should avoid using contaminated knives when harvesting cabbages since this may make cabbages rot quickly when they are stored. Bacterial soft rot can be controlled by planting cabbages on ridges or raised beds to prevent water logging around the plants  preventing other cabbage diseases such as black rot and damping off since they may provide opportunities for bacterial soft rot to develop. Farmers should harvest healthy cabbage heads first and store them in a cool  dry  airy place  wash hands and harvesting knives  remove and destroy diseased cabbages or left over stems in the field after harvesting. Farmers should also avoid growing crops in the cabbage family in the same field for a period of at least three seasons.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Bio-vision/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000StfuAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StfvAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StfwAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StfxAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop Management","id":"a0r70000000StfyAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StfzAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000Stg0AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000Stg1AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000Stg2AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000Stg3AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000Stg4AAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:21\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StWdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Site selection","id":"a0r70000000StgzAAC","content":"Sunflower is an annual plant  growing to a height of 2.0m (6-7ft) with a growth cycle of five months.

The land on which beans are planted should be big enough to allow crop rotation since beans should be grown on the same plot of land for only 1 to 2 seasons in a row When selecting a place to plant beans farmers should also look at the distance between the garden and the place where beans are going to be stored (long distances between the garden and store make transportation of harvest difficult).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StW2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to plant","id":"a0r70000000StiWAAS","content":"If a farmer is going to plant certified seeds (got from seed projects or researchers) then they should put only one seed in each hole.

Beans should be dried from morning till evening for at least 2 sunny days. Drying should not be done on the ground as this can make beans dirty, wet or get eaten by animals. Beans should be dried on a plastic sheet or on a raised platform.  Once a place for drying has been prepared farmers should separate well grown bean pods from weeds and very young bean pods. Bean pods should be well spread out and not piled together so that they can dry well. Farmers should watch over the beans as they dry so that they can cover them when it rains or chase away animals. Farmers should test beans (by biting or pinching a few of the bean seeds) to know if they are dry enough before they can be removed from the pods (threshed).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO_NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:17:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsiwAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kalabong","id":"a0r70000000SsrYAAS","content":"Akaka Lomiru. 775051770.Travels to Kitgum at 9am Monday, Gulu at 6pm.Has a Canter .

will go on heat within every 18 to 24 days. Heat period usually lasts between 6 and 30 hours. The effective heat period within which a cow will get pregnant lasts for 12 to 24 hours from the start of the signs of heat. Cows on heat will be restless, will become noisy, produce less milk and they may stop eating. Other signs of heat include a cow mounting others, standing still when mounted or approached from behind, the cow's vulva swelling, becoming red and a thin clear discharge which is like mucus coming out of the cow's vulva; the cow will also keep raising its tail.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJtAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Dairy breeds","id":"a0r70000000StNRAA0","content":"Dairy breed in Uganda are categorized into local and exotic breeds. Local breed include Ankole, small East African Zebu and Nganda. The exotic breeds include Friesian, jersey and Guernsey. Exotic breeds produce more milk than local breeds. With good management Friesian can produce above 20 liters per day, jersey above 15 liters per day and Guernsey above 20 liters per day while the local breeds can produce between 2 and 4 liters per day.  Exotic breed have a good performance but may not survive well in our local conditions  because they are easily attacked by diseases spread by ticks (especially if they are not well cared for) and they require very good management which most local farmers may not afford. Breed improvement is done by crossing exotic breeds with the local breeds to come up with breeds that are well adapted to local conditions and can produce larger amounts of milk compared to local breeds.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Structures that a cattle house should have","id":"a0r70000000StNSAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Housing for calves","id":"a0r70000000StNTAA0","content":"Calves must be kept in a comfortable place and protected from environmental stresses (like too much wind and rain) if they are to grow into quality animals to replace old ones. Calves may grow slowly or even die (especially the weaker ones) if they are exposed to cold, wet or windy conditions. Calves and 1 year old heifers (young cows that have not yet produced calves) that are kept in a good shelter (with a good dry area on which the animals can lie) will grow more quickly in cold conditions compared to those that are not kept in a shelter. The calf shed should be constructed on a dry surface and if possible with a concrete floor (farmers that cannot afford a concrete floor should compress the ground and make sure it is very hard and dry). Calf shelters do not need to be expensive structures but they should be built in ways that allow for easy cleaning and maintenance of hygienic conditions. Cattle shelters should be at least twice as deep as they are wide or high to prevent too much wind from entering even if the front is left open. Cattle shelters should also be well ventilated and positioned in such a way that they get enough sunlight but keep out rain and too much wind (shelters should have at least half of their walls solid to protect the calf from excessive wind while providing enough ventilation). Calves should get enough sunlight because it helps them warm themselves, disinfects bedding and stimulates production of vitamin D which helps calves use well the milk they take. The shelter is considered adequate if it is comfortable for a person to sit dressed only in light clothing. When building cattle shelters, focus should be put on protecting calves from extreme weather and not normal weather conditions because the hair on calves' skins is enough to provide protection from normal weather.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:42\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJuAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Different houses for cows of different ages","id":"a0r70000000StNUAA0","content":"It is a good practice to keep young cows in separate shelters according to their age and the condition in which they are (whether they are pregnant or sick).

The structure should provide cattle with enough space, comfort and air should move freely inside. For cattle kept under structures that have a roof, farmers should provide at least 12 square metres for a mature bull, 4 square metres for a cow and 12 square metres for a cow that is about to give birth. For cattle kept in structures without a roof, farmers should increase space and make it double the size of that which is provided for cattle kept in a structure that has a roof. Poorly designed housing can make management of cattle hard, makes it easy for certain diseases to attack cattle and the animals may also injure themselves. The floor of the cattle house should easy to clean and should be slanting towards a manure pit so that urine and water can easily flow away; concrete floors are easy to clean and are more durable. A good structure should be built with its short sides facing the direction of the sun to ensure that they provide enough shade. A shade should be provided over the area where cows rest and feed from; drinking troughs should also be in a shade to keep drinking water as cool as possible.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by

From the time it is planted, it produces seed in about two months. The leaves of this Dodo can be eaten as a vegetable and its seed can be used to make many products. Margret Nabatanzi from Kikandwa uses the seed of this Dodo to produce many products. She harvests the seed when the flowers (seed pulps) turn yellowish, places them on a polythene or mat and beats them to remove the seed. She dries the seed under the sun until they are dry. During a hot sunny day, the seeds will dry in one day. She then roasts the seed and after that, the seeds can be eaten or ground into flour which she uses to make soup, cakes or tea. She says eating the products from this seed helps to treat ulcers.\r\nGrain amaranth is called Dodo in Luganda, Runyakitara and Lhukonzo, lengalenga in Kiswahili\n\nAttribution: Provided by Margrete from Kikandwa.

Farmer can grow pumpkins with other crops like banana and coffee. Doroviko a farmer from Mubende grows pumpkins and uses them to make juice. He gets a mature pumpkin, washes it, cuts it and removes the seed. He cuts it into small pieces and pounds it. He then pours water and filters to obtain the juice. He uses different amounts of water depending on the type of pumpkin being processed. If he adds orange juice, he can store the juice for 7 days. It is important that you use a clean equipment when making this juice and wash them immediately after making the juice. The remains obtained after filtering the juice can be given to goats and pigs or dried and fed to chicken. Doroviko says taking the juice helps to control some diseases like hernia.\n\nAttribution: Provided by Doroviko from Mubende.

External parasites can be flying or crawling insects like biting flies  ticks  lice and mites (mites are very small and cannot be seen by the naked eye). Some external parasites spread diseases to cattle while others only cause damage on cattle's skin. Most parasites prefer staying on specific parts of cattle like the ears  neck  elbows  udder  scrotum and around the tail. SYMPTOMS of cattle being disturbed by external parasites include cattle losing weight  skin losing its normal good shiny condition and becoming dull  having scabies and becoming rough as well as developing wounds which may in some cases become infested with maggots especially if flies are on the cattle. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should keep the house where cattle are kept and the grazing area clean by removing all dung and leftover feeds  any cracks in the house where cattle are kept should be repaired immediately they are seen and the cattle house should also be regularly sprayed with the right insecticides and acaricides that can chase away external parasites (farmers should consult veterinary doctors in their area on which pesticides when controlling external parasites). Treatment: If the number of ticks on cattle is small then they can be removed by hand; animals that have external parasites should be separated from the rest of the herd and if cattle are attacked by too many external parasites then farmers should seek help from a veterinary doctor in their area.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Calf pneumonia Calf having mucus discharge from nose high body temperature difficulty in breathing and having a dull or weak appearance","id":"a0r70000000StMvAAK","content":"This disease is called disease is called calf pnumonia and is caused by a virus; if the affected calf gets other infections the disease can become worse.

Testing for mastitis: Milk the first drops of milk into a strip cup or on to a clean black surface (like a gum boot or the cover of a bucket) and spread the milk by bending the item into which you have put the drops of milk. Look at the milk closely and try to see if it has any colour changes  clots or is watery since all these are signs of mastitis. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Places in which cows are milked should be kept clean  milking should be done gently and teats should not be pulled roughly  if milking machines are used then they should be used correctly to avoid injuring cows teats  cow teats should be dipped in disinfectant solution after milking is done or dry cow therapy should be used (an antibiotic put into the teat of the cow when milking is stopped; farmers should seek advice from veterinary personnel on how to do this). Farmers should carry out a mastitis test daily; cows that have the disease should be milked last and milk got from them should be thrown away. Treatment: Farmers should seek advice from a veterinary doctor on what the best antibiotic to use is when treating mastitis. Milk or meat from cows that were getting treatment should not be consumed until the cows heal.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Anaplasmosis Gums eyes and other body parts becoming yellow high body temperature and difficulty in passing out dung","id":"a0r70000000StMyAAK","content":"This disease is called anaplasmosis and  it is spread by ticks and biting flies such as they suck blood from cattle (especially cross-bred and exotic breeds).

Before milking starts, the cow's udder and teats should be washed with warm water and dried with a clean cloth; the milker should also first massage the udder to encourage the  milk to flow. Milkers must remember to first wash and dry their hands before they start milking. At every milking, the first milk drops from each teat should be used to test for mastitis and cows found to have mastitis should be milked last. Milking should be done fast but gently and should be completed between 7 and 10 minutes. After milking, the teats should be dipped in a sanitizing solution (ask your veterinary doctor or at a farmer supply shop about the best to use) to remove any particles of milk and kill any bacteria on the teat. The cows should be offered with feeds after milking so that they can remain standing for at least 15 minutes to allow the teat canal to close before the cows lay down (this can help prevent mastitis). Milkers should wash their hands before milking each cow to avoid transmitting diseases from one cow to another. The milk collected should be sieved using a clean white cloth and then it should be measured and recorded so that each cow's level of milk production can be followed. Dairy farmers should make sure that milk is stored away from strong smelling things (like garlic, paraffin, paint) as well as poisonous chemicals or equipment used to apply chemicals. Milk should also be protected from direct sunlight as well as sources of heat. Milk should be taken to a collection centre or the market within 2 hours after milking.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Methods of milking","id":"a0r70000000StNBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJqAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General tips","id":"a0r70000000StNCAA0","content":"Milking is one of the most important activities carried out on a dairy farm. Milking should be done atleast 2 times a day; the time at which cows are milked should be maintained (frequently changing milking time should be avoided and it may lead to mastitis). The same person should do the milking regularly; try maintaining the same milker (the milker should be clean and milkers who are ill or who have poor hygiene habits like spitting or blowing noses when milking should not be used). Any changes that are to be introduced in how milking is done should be introduced slowly with time. Before milking  the udder and teats should be cleaned with slightly warm water  an antiseptic (like potassium permanganate solution) and dried with a clean cloth. The cow being milked should be in a comfortable position because animals that are comfortable produce more milk. When milking  each cow should be milked between 5 and 7 minutes. Milking pails in which milk is put should be clean (farmers should try buying milking pails that have a dome shaped top instead of using ordinary buckets or vessels). All milk should be completely milked out of the cow because leaving some milk in the udder can encourage occurance of diseases like mastitis. Cows that are suspected to be sick should be milked last to prevent spreading of diseases. If farmers want good quality milk then they should keep the areas where cows are kept clean and the cows should also be kept in a healthy condition.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Storing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Processing feeds","id":"a0r70000000StNEAA0","content":"Processing involves making changes to pasture, fodder or any other type of cattle food so that it can be stored for a longer time and to make easier for the cattle to digest as well as gain the desired nutrients from it. Processing cattle feeds involves cutting long pastures such as rice, maize, sorghum millet straw and elephant grass into small pieces as well as grinding grain feed (like maize, sorghum and soybean). Processing may also involve adding some things like salt, molasses or urea in the cattle feeds (urea SHOULD NOT be added to feeds for calves that are below 6 months old). When cutting pastures into small pieces farmers can use knives or machetes. NOTE: Processing cattle feeds has costs in terms of both time and money; farmers must carefully look at how they benefit from carrying it out and compare to the costs (money and time) involved before deciding to do it.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding dairy cattle during dry seasons","id":"a0r70000000StNFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding cows that are producing milk","id":"a0r70000000StNGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to feed young female cows that are above 6 months","id":"a0r70000000StNHAA0","content":"Heifers are young cows (especially those that have not yet given birth to a calf).

From 3 to 6 months heifers should be fed on good quality fodder and it is best to give the calf as much as it can eat; heifers at this stage should also be given 1.5 kg of good quality dairy concentrates each day. The amount of concentrates being given to heifers should slowly be reduced so that by 6 months they are being given only 1 kg of concentrates. From 6 to 18 months of age, heifers can be fed on good quality fodder (like dark green napier grass that is 1 metre tall); if the fooder that is available is not of very good quality however farmers can continue feeding the animals with dairy concentrates. Clean water and a mineral lick (this can bebought from farm supply shops) should also be provided for the animals at all times.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by EADD\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to feed calves","id":"a0r70000000StNIAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJrAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Water for dairy cattle","id":"a0r70000000StNJAA0","content":"Dairy cattle, like all other animals need water for their bodies to function normally; animals can survive longer without food than they can without water.

Dairy farmers should make sure that clean water is available for their animals to drink at all times.

Fish farming requires some money to start and needs to be carried out on land which has a nearby source of water that flows throughout the year. The money is used to buy equipment like hoes, pick axes and spades to construct the pond, pay labour for construction of the pond, buy fingerlings (young fish) and feeds for fish. Before starting a fish farm, farmers should first find out if there is market for fish, which type of fish the available customers want and how much they can buy; all this will help farmers avoid losses due to lack of market and low market prices. Carrying out fish farming in an area where people's culture and customs do not allow them to eat fish is very likely to lead to losses for a fish farmer. The fish farmer should draw a plan of how the farm will be managed, inputs needed, costs of buying these inputs, expected number of fish per year as well as expected profits. Farmers who have never done fish farming should start with a small pond to help them get experience before they can put a lot of money in the business.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StGhAAK","content":"Fish is a source of proteins and is liked by very many people. Most people who do not eat meat due to health problems atleast eat fish and this has increased market for fish. Fish farming refers to raising and keeping of fish in ponds or tanks for commercial purposes. Fish farming requires little land since a large number of fish can be kept in a small pond compared to the land needed for keeping other animals like goats and cows. Fish farming also enables farmers to use wetlands that may not be used for growing of crops and rearing of animals. Fish can be fed on waste from the kitchen, animal feed leftovers and as well as manure which ensures that farmers can get income from these wastes. Currently, fish in Uganda is mainly obtained from lakes and rivers and the number of fish in these rivers and lakes is declining rapidly due to use of poor fishing methods (small sized nets). Reduction of fish got from lakes and rivers gives an opportunity for farmers that invest in fish farming to get a good income. Fish has ready market both in rural and urban areas and the farmer can harvest a few fish each day depending on the number of people willing to buy. This avoids wastage due to lack of market. Farmers need to get skills and advice on how best to carry out fish farming before they start investing their money in it.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, Buvuma District Council\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Local cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StG3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Exotic cattle","id":"a0r70000000StGjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellowish-white diarrhoea shedding of feathers high death rate","id":"a0r70000000StKpAAK","content":"This is Fowl typhoid disease.

The reasons for castration include making the pigs docile for easy handling or to remove the male smell from their meat. Farmers should castrate piglets early before they are 3 weeks old because at that age they are small and easy to hold, they recover faster with little effect on their growth and they have good protection from infection given by milk they are suckling from their mothers. When carrying out castration, farmers should hold piglets by their hind legs and clean the area around the scrotum with a detergent or any disinfectant. The farmer should firmly hold the testicles, push them outwards till the skin of the scrotum is tight against them then a cut should be made down the length of each testicle. Care should be taken to only cut through the skin and not the testicles; the cut must be at the lower end of the scrotum to allow easy drainage of the blood. The farmer should then pull both testicles through the opening, twist the cord attached to one of the testicles and scrape (drag or pull) the knife across the cord until it breaks; the same should be done for the other testicle.

Another way of supplying iron to piglets is placing clods of red soil in the pen in which the piglets are since eating such soil gives iron to piglets (farmers should get clean soil from areas where no people or animals have stepped (like anthills) to protect piglets from worms).

Some female pigs especially the young ones can injure or kill their piglets when they are giving birth (by lying on them) so farmers should remove piglets until the process of giving birth has ended and they can be returned after the mother has settled down. Piglets may be born when they are all covered in membranes which may prevent them from breathing; if breathing does not start the farmer should clear the membranes away, massage the chest area, hold the piglets by the legs and swing them gently since this helps them to start breathing. If some piglets are too weak to suckle or fail to locate a teat the farmer should guide them to a teat.

Eggs should be stored with the broad end facing upwards (broad end has an air sac through which the egg breathes). To prevent rotting, eggs should be stored in a clean and dry place. Since fertilized eggs get spoilt fast, eggs that have spent more than 10 days should not be given to the hen to incubate/sleep on them.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Institute of Development Strategies\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Getting parent stock","id":"a0r70000000StL4AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management systems","id":"a0r70000000StL5AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StHnAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hay or feed store","id":"a0r70000000StLMAA0","content":"Store fodder  for use during the dry season  in stores/barns built adjacent to the goat house that is roofed and has a wooden floor to allow air to pass underneath.

The parasites attack the inside of the ear and cause swelling and a lot of irritation. The affected rabbit will become restless and shakes its head from side to side. The rabbit may also damage its ears from banging them against the side of the cage or house in which rabbits are kept. This can lead to small swellings appearing under the skin on the inside part of the affected ear. When the ear is touched it is hot and the rabbit will appear to be in pain. With time  the swellings (which can become big) will become very hard. Prevention and treatment:  It is important to clear mites from rabbits since they can move from one animal to another. Ears of all the rabbits kept should be checked regularly. Remove the crusts  scales with the help of cotton wool and then apply ear canker preparation (it is readily available in veterinary outlets) or ear drops. Until the mites are removed the rabbit will continue shaking its head. A farmer can test if there are mites in a rabbits ear by gently inserting a cotton bud into the ear and wiping it around. If there are mites they will be stuck to the cotton bud with a brown substance. The mites look like very small fleas; they cause alot of trouble to the rabbit if they are not controlled. Farmers can also dust the rabbits with recommended chemicals or use diatomite powder if it is available. If you keep the rabbit houses clean and dry then the problem of mites is not likely to occur.\n\nAttribution: MAAIF, NARO, INFONET-BIOVISION\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Egg production","id":"a0r70000000StLvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StLwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Feeding","id":"a0r70000000StLxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Management of chicken layers","id":"a0r70000000StLyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Breeding","id":"a0r70000000StLzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StIzAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Managing chicken houses","id":"a0r70000000StM0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:14:37\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StJ0AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How to collect and store propolis","id":"a0r70000000StM1AAK","content":"When harvesting propolis a knife or hive tool should be used to collect the smears and lumps of propolis from parts of the hive but care should be taken not to remove paint from the hive and also not to damage the wood from which the hive is made.

Bees usually carry waste out of and away from the hive but if a small lizard or mouse finds its way into the hive and dies there, bees may be unable to carry it out through the hive entrance and in such a case bees cover it in propolis to prevent it from rotting and creating bad smells inside the hive. Beekeepers can make bees produce more propolis by making spaces found inside the hive bigger.

A cow on heat will also produce less milk than it usually produces. At milking time, cows should be observed for atleast 10 minutes about 3 times each day; early morning and late afternoon are the best times to look out for signs of heat in cows since at these times cows are calm (heat may occur during the night so observation in the early morning and late evening is very important).

Know the type and variety of seeds recommended in your area. Such varieties should have the recommendation from the Ministry of Agriculture  NARO  NAADS or extension workers.  2. Note all the quality characteristics and standards on the label and be sure they are what you require. Read all promotional posters. Ask for advice on how and when to plant those seeds.  3. Check the seed packages carefully. All certified seed has been inspected during production by Ministry of Agriculture  and will have an identification label attached to the seed package. It has been tested to make sure it is pure and will germinate.  4. Look around the store to ensure that the seed has been kept properly and protected from rain and excessive heat. Check the package carefully for any signs of damage or insect infestation.  5. Look at the date when the seed was produced. Dont buy seed that is more than one year old or has passed the listed expiry date.  6. Always KEEP your seed package and RECEIPT so that you can complain if there is a problem.  7. Buy early so you can test the germinationn before you plant your entire field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by UNADA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsfAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General info","id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:02\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsgAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Overview","id":"a0r70000000StstAAC","content":"All plants need food (nutrients) for them to grow properly.

Coffee berry disease does not kill coffee trees but it greatly reduces yield which farmers would have got from their coffee crops. Signs of the disease include young expanding coffee berries slowly turning black. Small water filled spots appear on the coffee berries and these spots quickly become dark, sunken and as they spread they make coffee berries rot. Coffee berries also often drop from the branch at an early stage of the disease. Lesions may also occur on young berry stalks, causing them to break off the tree before the berries are affected. The disease also affects ripening berries causing a 'brown blight' phase and this phase is characterised by dark, sunken lesions which cover the ripe red berries. The coffee berry disease may also infect flowers under very wet conditions, and causes brown lesions on petals. Farmers can control the disease by removing berries which are affected from coffee trees, pruning coffee trees after harvesting, removing old stems and thinning out branches as well as timely spraying with copper(NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthkAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Yellow and orange spots on bottom side of leaves and upper side of leaves losing green colour","id":"a0r70000000StpwAAC","content":"This disease is called coffee leaf rust and it affects leaves causing them to drop if the disease is severe. The disease is favoured by wet warm conditions.The first symptom is formation of small pale yellow spots in diameter on the underside of leaves. As the spots expand they become powdery and yellow to orange and the leaves eventually drop off. This can lead to coffee berry loss and reduction in yields and quality. Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. To prevent coffee leaf rust plant improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee. \n\nAttribution: Information provided by NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SteDAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Making shade trees","id":"a0r70000000StpxAAC","content":"Establishing shade trees in coffee gardens provides good growing conditions for young coffee trees.

Space left between the planting rows should be 2.4m by 2.4m apart to ease other activities which will be done later when caring for coffee and to ensure correct plant population (about 640 coffee trees should be planted per acre). When digging holes farmers should pile top soil on the upper slope and the subsoil on the lower slope in relation to the hole. Holes made for planting should be 60cm by 60cm by 60cm (2ft by 2ft by 2ft) in size for optimum growing conditions and quick establishment of the tender young coffee roots.

If diseases like late blight occur, farmers may harvest irish potatoes before they are fully grown to avoid making a total loss. When harvesting, irish potato plants should be pulled out of the soil using hands if the ground is soft; if the ground is hard, hoes can be used to dig the plant out of the soil but care should be taken not to cut or damage the irish potatoes in the soil.  A good way of protecting irish potatoes from damage as they are being harvested or transported is by cutting the top parts of irish potato plants off about 10 to 14 days before harvesting is done (this helps potatoes to develop a hard skin while they are still in soil). If the harvested potatoes are to be used for planting, farmers should store them in heaps or piles for about 1 to 2 weeks so that their skins can become hard (during this time farmers should identify and remove any rotten or cut potatoes).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and NaCRRI\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StY7AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StY8AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StY9AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYAAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Types","id":"a0r70000000StYBAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSMAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StYCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Preparation and Planting","id":"a0r70000000StYEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean types","id":"a0r70000000StYFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SthlAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"How and when to plant","id":"a0r70000000Stq4AAC","content":"Farmers should plant and maintain a plant population of 640 coffee trees per acre.

Press lightly near the stem for maximum contact between roots and soil and then water.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Rice","id":"a0r70000000SsUxAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 14%; damaged/immature grains: 2.0%; foreign matter (total): 2.0%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Beans","id":"a0r70000000SsUyAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 14%; foreign matter: 0.5%; defective beans (total): 2.0% [under this, pest damage: 1.0%, broken/split: 2.0%, other defective beans: 1.0%]; bean classes that blend: 0.5%]; bean classes that contrast: 2.5%; other grains: 0.5%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUfAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Maize","id":"a0r70000000SsUzAAK","content":"Grade 1 quality specifications are: Moisture content: 13.5%; foreign matter (total): 0.5% [under this, inorganic matter: 0.25% and filth: 0.1%]; broken grain:  2.0%; defective grain (total): 4.0% [under this, pest damage: 1.0%, rotten and diseased grain: 2.0%, discoloured grain: 0.5%, immature and shrivelled grain: 1.0%]; other grains: 0.5%\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Uganda Commodities Exchange\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kampala","id":"a0r70000000SsV0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Masindi","id":"a0r70000000SsV1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Jinja","id":"a0r70000000SsV2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SsUgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kasese","id":"a0r70000000SsV3AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-18 07:00:03\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsoAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Lumino","id":"a0r70000000SttrAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StspAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ryeru","id":"a0r70000000SttsAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kaproron","id":"a0r70000000StttAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kaptanya","id":"a0r70000000SttuAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:22:05\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StsqAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Town Council","id":"a0r70000000SttvAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-13 11:49:10\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StssAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Best seed practices","id":"a0r70000000SttwAAC","content":"In order to get the best out of your seeds  you must ensure the following:  Seeds to be planted should be properly stored and handled.

Farmers should use sharp equipment when pruning to prevent tearing or damaging bark on the trees. The first pruning is to about 2 metres and can be done from the ground but as the trees grow taller farmers may need to attach poles or handles to pruning saws so that pruning can be done higher (ladders should never be used when pruning high unless if the ground is very flat, even and firm). When pruning bigger branches, farmers should make 2 cuts in the stem and the first cut should be made about 20 cm away from the stem while the second cut is made very close to the stem. The first cut removes weight off the branch so that when the second cut is made the weight does not rip the branch down and cause damage to the stem and tree bark (stem damage from ripping takes a long time to heal, leaves a wound through which diseases can enter the tree and leaves a scar which reduces quality of timber).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"When to prune","id":"a0r70000000StqKAAS","content":"Farmers should always prune before branches die since pruning after branches are dead makes dead knots form on the tree.

Farmers growing eucalyptus may do the first pruning when the trees are about 1 to 2 years old and pruning height should be 2 metres. Second round of pruning may be done when eucalyptus trees are between 3 to 4 years old and pruning height should be 4 metres. The third round of pruning can be done when eucalyptus trees are between 5 and 6 years old and pruning height is 7 metres (some farmers stop pruning trees at this stage). A fourth round of pruning may be done when the trees are between 7 and 9 years old and pruning height is 10 metres (farmers should note that doing higher pruning is expensive).

Pruning helps remove heavy branches off a tree before they break off and cause damage to the tree. Pruning also helps remove branches before they die and rot which can cause decay in a tree and can lead to tree diseases. Pruning also raises height of tree branches from the ground which reduces risk of a fire moving from the ground to the upper parts of trees. Pruning at the right time throughout the tree's life ensures that a tree only has knots in the centre of the tree (knots are irregular formations in timber which look like scars) since new wood grows over the scar once branches have been removed (pruned). Knots reduce quality of timber because they do not look good, make it hard for carpenters to work with wood and they also reduce strength of timber.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by SPGS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StiAAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"What is pruning","id":"a0r70000000StqMAAS","content":"Pruning is the physical removal of a tree's lower branches and it is usually done in stages throughout the life of trees growing in a plantation.

The seedlings or trees which are removed during thinning can be used as firewood, poles or can even be sold if farmers are close to markets. When doing thinning for the first time, farmers can remove one whole line of seedlings or trees but the thinning done after the first one should be more selective (farmers should focus on removing the poor quality seedlings or trees) and should leave behind only the best trees.

Important things to look out for when fighting a fire are what the fire is doing, how fast it is moving, how strongly it is burning, what it is burning and where it is going. The best way to put out a fire is to fight ahead of it (clearing or burning vegetation ahead of it so that by the time it reaches there it has nothing to burn and dies out). When the front of the fire is cut off, people fighting the fire can start trying to put it out from the back and sides by removing all vegetation which it may burn and this will help to slowly start making the fire smaller and easier to put out. When fighting a fire it is important to make sure that everyone has somewhere to escape to and when the fire gets too strong they can fall back to a safer area and continue fighting the fire.

The length of the beds depends on the field shape and farmer’s choices. Soil in the seed bed should be dug until it is smooth and fine. The beds are separated by a pathway of 0.5m to enable the farmer to carryout operations like weeding. A shed should be put over the young plants to protect them from heavy rains and too much sunlight. This shed can be built using spear grass or banana leaves. Before sowing or planting, seeds should be treated with fungicide like Metalaxyl or Victory. This helps to prevent ants from carrying away the seeds and helps control damping off disease. Dig lines or channels at a spacing of 0.5m - 0.75m apart and 2-3 inches deep across the beds to plant the seeds. Cover the seeds lightly and water them. Mulch with rice hulls or straw or grass and water regularly. Seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 4-5 weeks, when they are about 4-6 inches high. The seedlings in the nursery should be made ready for planting in the field by reducing water and exposing them to sun one week before planting.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Land preparation","id":"a0r70000000StYZAA0","content":"Fields should be dug before, or at the same time the seeds are sown.Allow enough time between digging and transfering the plants from the nursery to the main garden, so as to expose the soil to sunlight and to birds, wasps and what are known as friendly insects, which will feed on pests and help to remove weed seeds. After digging the field, then the beds should be shaped. Where soils have a heavy clay content, or are poorly drained, make mounds or raised beds. The beds should be at least 100 cm (40 inches) wide and 30 - 40 cm (12 - 15 inches) high. Weeds may begin to emerge before one is ready to transplant, in which case a chemical herbicide that does not stay long in the soil like Glyphosate, or hand weeding is recommended; this will provide the cleanest possible field.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IDEA\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Hot water treatment of seed","id":"a0r70000000StYaAAK","content":"Hot water treatment of hot pepper seeds is at a temperature of 500C for a period of 30 minutes.This temperature can be determined locally by dipping your hands in this water.When you dip your hands in it,this water should not burn your hands however it is recommended that you use a thermometer.Place the seeds in a loose cotton bag and dip this bag in the hot water but do not let it touch the bottom of the container that has this hot water.Leave it in the water for 30 minutes then remove the bag and cool it in clean cold water to stop the heating.Spread the seeds on a clean dry paper to cool and dry under a shade.Do not keep treated seeds.Sow them immediately on a well-prepared seed bed.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Infonet-biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting materials","id":"a0r70000000StYbAAK","content":"Hot peppers are grown from seed.

They are leaf eating caterpillar pests that often feed heavily leaving only maize stems and the center of leaves. They often make sudden outbreaks after large amounts of moths move to an area. They first appear as large numbers of very small green caterpillars feeding on leaves. Adult armyworms are velvet black caterpillars with fine yellow lines and are about 35 cm long. \r\nSigns and symptoms\r\nSigns of armyworms include surfaces of maize leaves being eaten off to expose inner layers of the leaves young maize plants and their leaves being completely eaten and large numbers of caterpillars being seen moving in or near the garden. \r\nPrevention and control\r\nTo control armyworms maize farmers should spray pesticides or insecticides like dimethoate or Ambush in circles in amounts that cannot damage the plant along the edges of the maize garden to prevent armyworms from getting into the garden. This is efficient when the caterpillars are suspected in the neighboring gardens. Those that are already in the garden can be sprayed with dudu cyper.

Termites destroy maize roots and stem bases making maize crops wilt, dry up and fall. Damage continues even after maize has fallen. If termites are many they can destroy all the maize in the field especially if they attack when maize is still young. Old maize attacked by termites will produce very poor grain quality. To control termites, maize farmers can use chemicals like terminator, pyrinex,  troban,  endo sulfan,  malataf or dusban. When using Dusban (chloryrifos) a farmer should apply by measuring between 200 to 700mls of dursban mixed 20litres of water per termite mound or anthill. Where there are no termite mounds in the garden, 50 gm (about 5table spoons) of Regent 3-g (fipronil) should be mixed with 20 litres of water and applied to all the locations in the field where termites are feeding. The farmer can also use insecticides that are absorbed by maize (like imidacloprid) to fight termite attacks. Other ways to control termites include ploughing field to destroy the termite nests and channels so that the termites are exposed to ants birds chicken which feed on them. Practicing crop rotation with legumes like beans can also help in reducing termites. Farmers should remove plant remains especially wet and rotting woods. Maize should also be harvested at the right time as termites often attack maize left in the field after they have matured\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-11 12:39:00\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZgAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Holes on maize grain and a lot of grain dust in stored maize","id":"a0r70000000StnUAAS","content":"They can make holes and live in wood and maize. They are cylindrical dark brown and are 3 to 5 mm in length. Large grain borers grow from young to adult in about 27 days under favourable conditions. They can attack maize both in field and storage. Signs of large grain borers include holes on maize grains and grain dust in stored maize. Damage is caused by both adults and young large grain borers. Maize grain attacked by large grain borers loses weight reduces in quality due to presence of droppings, shells and insect parts in the maize grain. Maize seeds attacked by large grain borers may also not germinate when planted because the borer destroys the growing points of the maize. To control large grain borers  farmers should harvest maize quickly when it is ready for harvest  store maize in a clean store and in clean containers or sacks and if possible sell the maize stock in the first 3 months after harvest since the extent of large brain borer infestation during the first 3 months of storage is generally low. Mixing diatomite powder with grain before storing in bags or dusting newly harvested dry cobs before storing them with diatomite also helps fight large grain borers (use 1 kg of Diatomite per bag of maize or grain). Also farmers are advised to use fumigants (pesticides that produce gases) like Quick phos (Aluminium phosphide). For bulk grain loosely heaped on wooden platforms apply 2 to 5tablets per ton, this done by putting the tablets on a plate and pushing the plate under the heaped maize grains and covering tightly with a tarpaulin for one day.

To control rats in maize, farmers should maintain clean surroundings by weeding or slashing bushes and clearing garbage since rats usually invade maize fields from nearby bushes and garbage but may fear to cross open ground.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:18:11\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StVoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Plant management","id":"a0r70000000StVpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StVqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS1AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StVrAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS2AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Arabica","id":"a0r70000000StVsAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StVtAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StVuAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StVvAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StVwAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StVxAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StVyAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Management","id":"a0r70000000StVzAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS3AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StW0AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil Manangement","id":"a0r70000000StW1AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StW2AAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS4AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Where to get improved seeds","id":"a0r70000000StW3AAK","content":"You can search through the Farm Inputs section of CKW Search to get contacts of suppliers from whom you can buy good bean seeds.\n\nBreeder seeds can also be got from the National Crops Resources research Institute at Namulonge.\n\nImproved seeds can also be got  from Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institutes (ZARDI's)  seed companies and stockists across Uganda like FICA  Victoria,  Harvest Farm Seeds  Farmer groups in Wakiso,  Mpigi,  Mbarara,  Kabaale,  Kisoro,  Masindi,  Apac,  Mubende,  Bushyenyi,  Sironko,  Kamwenge and Kabarole. \n\n\nFor more information on improved bean seed types contact National Agricultural Research Organisation(NARO)  National Crops Resesources Research Institute_Namulonge.

If the soil has dried  it will be necessary to use either a spade or similar tool to loosen the soil and harvest the roots. Carrots are usually ready for harvesting 60-85 days after sowing. Mature roots should be orange-colored internally down to the blunt tip. A good market price can be fetched from young carrots with a fresh top  but leaving the top on dries out the root quickly and reduces the marketing period of the crop. An alternative is to cut the top back to about 2 cm and package attractively. For mature carrots the tops are cut down completely to avoid storage rots before marketing. Carrots should be stored separately from other vegetables to prevent a bitter flavor induced by ethylene (a colorless gas with a sweet odor that is produced by many fruits and vegetables that accelerates the ripening process). Generally carrots store better when they are mature and harvested under moist conditions  and undamaged and free of diseases and pests.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Biovision and NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS5AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWCAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWDAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden Preparation","id":"a0r70000000StWEAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StWFAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StWGAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS6AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWHAA0","content":"Cabbage is often hand-harvested when heads are firm to the touch but before cracking begins.

At times green pods are picked over a long period in home gardens or hedge crops. When growing pigeon peas farmers usually practice ratoon cropping (harvesting pods in one season and leaving pigeon pea plants to produce new pods in the next season). After harvest the stems are cut back to enable the plants to grow again and a second crop is harvested in the following season. After harvesting, farmers can spread out whole pigeon pea plants or pods to dry in the air after which they are threshed (using hands or cattle) and the seeds are cleaned. Clean pigeon peas prevent insect attack which can lead to alot of damage in the harvested crop. Farmers can also store pigeon peas as split peas (removed from pods) to reduce attacks from small beetles which are called bruchids.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWWAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StWXAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StS9AAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWYAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StWZAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Commercial varieties","id":"a0r70000000StWaAAK","content":"There are; Sunfola (black seeded  thin seed coat  medium stature  early maturing  40% oil content and up to 1800kg/ha yield)   S400  S430  and SH 3422 whose average seed yields are 1300- 2000 kg/ha and with an oil content of 50%.

One of the symptoms in the fruit is a blackened, dry cavity in the side of the fruit due to one or more \"eyes\" having died. This is known as \"dead eye\". Infection of very young fruit results in an irregular arrangement of fruitlets as some fail to develop. Attacked fruits may also fail to develop a crown. These spots enlarge and the infection spreads into the fruit itself, by which time the crown will often have dried out. The flesh of fruits thus infected will be discoloured and necrotic below the butt of the crown. The whole fruit may eventually become affected.

Field management offers potential effective control. Cut off the fruits showing early symptoms of infection. This will prevent the spread of infections into the fruits.

Use certified seeds and should be dressed with a broad spectrum fungicide such as captan or thiran for protection against soil borne pathogens.  After planting  cover them with a screen  as the birds and animals love to dig the seeds out. You can also start them in a seedbed (free of weeds) and with fine non compacted soil with organic matter. Transfer seedlings when they are small. Clear the main garden free of trees  shrubs and weeds. No shading is required. Till the land thoroughly  to a fine non compacted soil. A second ploughing is necessary if planting is on virgin land. Otherwise a single ploughing is sufficient on already cultivatable land. The crop is line planted (as opposed to broadcast) at a spacing of 2.5 X 1.7ft and 2 seeds per hole. An application of P205 fertilizer before planting and 60kg/ha of Nitrogen at thinning are recommended. Thinning can be done to leave only one or two plants to a hill resulting in an approximate plant population of 55 000 plants/ha. Lower plant populations are recommended in areas where rainfall is limited (on average 33 000-45 000 plants per acre in semi-arid areas). This compares with a recommendation for 45 000-60 000 plants/ha in areas where there is more moisture. Sunflower always point their blooms to the rising sun in the East. Keep this in mind as you determine where to plant them. A planting depth of 1 to 3.5 in. allows sunflower seeds to reach available moisture and gives satisfactory stands. Deeper plantings result in reduced stands and yields. Sowing can be done by corn planter in the furrows and after 10-12 days of germination.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StWeAAK","content":"Yield will largely depend on the number of heads per hectare. Plant population is therefore the major determinant of yield. When all other factors are constant  low populations will result in heavier but more seeds per head and the reverse is true. Additionally yield varies with variety  weather  soil conditions and pests and diseases. After flower formation (budding)  sunflower will be ready for harvesting after about 30 to 40 days or more. At this stage  ready plants for harvesting will have the back of the head turned from green to yellow and the bracts have changed to brown. To harvest  cut the stems using a Panga at about 3ft above ground and the heads spiked face down on them and left to dry. Do not delay to harvest as seeds become too dry and shell out leading to field losses. It is better to harvest at 14-15% moisture. The dried heads are then threshed by beating them with sticks on clean materials. A maize Sheller can also be used. Plantation farmers can use any suitably modified combines. Dry to a moisture content of about 14% before storage.\n\nAttribution: NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:35\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSAAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Nutritional Value Per 100g","id":"a0r70000000StWfAAK","content":"Energy 2 385 kJ (570 kcal)  Carbohydrates 18.76g  Sugars 2.62g  Dietary fiber 10.5g  Fat 49.57g  saturated 5.20g  monounsaturated 9.46g  polyunsaturated 32.74g  Protein 22.78g  Thiamine (Vit.

Wheat crop is harvested at maturity and must be dried thoroughly before threshing.  Small scale farmers usually cut the wheat using hand sickles and this is done when the heads of wheat have become hard.  Wheat is then tied into bundles and stoked to be threshed when completely dry. If birds are not a problem then wheat plants can be stacked or spread out to dry in the sun in a clean area preferably on a cement slab or plastic sheet in order to reduce losses. Threshing is done by beating with flails  humans or animals stepping on the straw with their feet  or by driving a small tractor over the straw. A wheat sheaf may also be beaten by hand against a low wall  an oil drum  or a wagon bed  so that the grains fall into a container or onto a mat.

If the straw of wheat has had disease or pest problems it should be removed from the field and either sold or used as fuel or animal feed in order not to leave pests and diseases to survive in the field. If the straw is healthy  it is good to use as mulch for other crops (livestock does not like wheat straw) or to incorporate it into the soil.

Coffee leaf rust disease also causes leaves to drop and if this happens alot the entire coffee tree can die as well as lose coffee berries. Another sign of coffee leaf rust disease is very small coffee berries which turn black before they are fully ripe. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves). Other ways of controlling coffee leaf rust include conducting proper and regular pruning and weeding of coffee.

In Uganda onions can be grown all through the year especially in areas where irrigation is possible.\n\nAttribution: Biovision, NACCRI, NARO, MAAIF\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post Harvest Handling","id":"a0r70000000StXKAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXLAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXMAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXNAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSGAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXOAA0","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SuBdAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop advice","id":"a0r70000000SuGrAAK","content":"Benards.

This can lead to coffee berry loss and loss of yields and quality.Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types like catimor which are more resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can be controlled by spraying arabica coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before arabica coffee starts flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).

Young parts of coffee trees may also die followed by the larger branches later on. Prevention and control: Farmers can prevent coffee leaf rust by planting improved coffee seed types which are resistant to diseases. Coffee leaf rust can also be controlled by spraying robusta coffee trees with copper before the start of the rains or if it is an emergency, copper sprays can be used at an interval of 21 days starting just before robusta coffee begins flowering (NOTE: Spraying coffee with copper should be done in the morning on a dry, sunny day since this gives the plants enough time to dry and prevents the solution from penetrating the leaves).

In order to provide the required cold conditions and water vapour, farmers should place buckets or pots of water in the house where mushrooms are being grown; the mushrooms should also be watered atleast twice a day (in the morning and evening) but farmers that can afford to water more than 2 times should do it. It is best to grow mushrooms in a house that has a grass thatched roof because such houses are cool inside; mushrooms can also be grown in houses that have ironsheet roofs but farmers using such houses should lay out some thatch on the ironsheet roof or make a ceiling in the house to help make it cool inside. The house in which mushrooms are grown should have windows to let in light since it is needed by the mushrooms as they grow; the light inside the house should be enough for someone standing in the centre of the room to read a book. The farmer should put windows on the house to provide light.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSHAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXYAA0","content":"Mushrooms used to be collected (harvested) from forests and bushes but these days they can be grown in a house.

Other vanilla pests include: Chicken which damage vanilla roots by scratching away the mulched part, exposing the roots and making the plant dry up. Termites are also a major vanilla pest especially in the dry season (termites can kill or stop the support tree from growing normally). There are also black ants that can damage flower buds that have not yet opened which makes flowers drop off before they are pollinated; these black ants also encourage mealy bugs and scale insects to attack vanilla and make flowers drop off before pollination occurs. Thieves can sometimes also steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. PREVENTION and CONTROL: Farmers should make sure that chicken are kept out of vanilla gardens. Black ants can be controlled by applying ash on the soil around the support tree and vanilla vines. Vanilla gardens should be near farmers' homes because this makes it easier to inspect the vanilla everyday and may keep away thieves that steal vanilla while it is still in the garden. Vanilla stores should also be properly contructed to keep out thieves and other pests (any cracks or holes that develop should be closed or repaired quickly).\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NAADS\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Disease","id":"a0r70000000StXcAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXdAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXeAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSIAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXfAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXgAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXhAAK","content":"Ginger is ready for harvest in about 9 to 10 months after it is planted. Signs that ginger is mature enough for harvest include yellowing of leaves and stems of ginger plants breaking. Farmers can choose to leave ginger in the soil (for up to 2 years) if there is no market for them; when the rains come this ginger will germinate again and continue growing for another season. In Uganda ginger is harvested using hands (in a way that is similar to how sweet potatoes are harvested ); mature ginger is dug up from the soil using a hoe and then farmers use hands to break it off the main stem. Roots should be removed from harvested ginger, soil should be cleaned off and the ginger should then be washed in water and laid out in a shade to dry (clean ginger will be bought at better prices at the market). Under good growing conditions and when proper spacing is used at planting, farmers may harvest about 10 sacks of hybrid ginger or 5 sacks of local ginger from 1 acre of land.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by MUK\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Pests","id":"a0r70000000StXiAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000StXjAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Soil management","id":"a0r70000000StXkAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Crop management","id":"a0r70000000StXlAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Planting","id":"a0r70000000StXmAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Garden preparation","id":"a0r70000000StXnAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"General information","id":"a0r70000000StXoAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Post harvest handling","id":"a0r70000000StXpAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StSKAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000StXqAAK","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-05-30 15:16:36\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGjWAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Signs of heat in cattle","id":"a0r70000000TGswAAG","content":"The most important sign for animal ready to mate or be inseminated is that ‘the animal will stands still (in one place) and allows other animals to mount it or when touched at the back, it stands normally with its tail lifted upwards (this is called standing period).

For farmers to avoid these losses, they should dry their crops well and clean them before storing them, remove crops from last season from the store before putting new crops so that pests from the old crops do not damage the new crops, store crops in a clean store that is not leaking and closing all cracks in the walls with mud or cow dung to avoid pests from entering the store. Remove seed that is affected by diseases and pests from clean seed before storing (the buyers buy poor quality seeds at very low prices leading to less profit to farmers).For more information, call 178/0312178178 or contact your qualified person in your area.\n\nAttribution: Grameen Foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-11 11:32:10\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGeaAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Clay soils","id":"a0r70000000TGjVAAW","content":"Also soils that contain a lot of clay like in the swampy areas are not good for maize production since such clay soils hold too much water which is not good for maize production and may cause flooding in case rains are too much.

Maize also provides farm families, produce buyers, processors, exporters and transporters with income. It can be kept for long periods of time (ranging from 3 months to even a year or more) under good care and storage conditions, this way maize will be available for use in case other crops fail or due to bad weather conditions like drought, floods and mud slides. Maize also has a lot of products and byproducts, like maize brand which is feed for animals, maize cobs which can be used as firewood, maize crop residues which can be used as mulch or feed for animals. Also maize can be used in the making of local brew. Maize is also a good source of starch and oil.

For example if a farmer is practicing enterprise diversification and one crop fails due to bad weather, pests and diseases, the farmer may not suffer as much compared to one who depends on only one enterprise or farm business (if completely destroyed). The one practicing enterprise diversification will still benefit by feeding and selling food from other crops, 2) If the price of one crop is low, the farmer still benefits from high prices of other planted crops; in cases where prices of all crops or products from farmer businesses fall, it is good to store the produce and wait for better prices, 3) Planting more crops in the same garden also helps to control soil erosion and improve soil fertility if crops like beans, groundnuts are included in the garden, 4) Planting more crops in the same garden also helps to control soil erosion and improve soil fertility if crops like beans, groundnuts are included in the garden. 5) One enterprise (crop or animal) supports the other; for example manure from animals can be used to fertilize the soils (this helps to maintain continuous and high crop yield hence more income/profits to farmer), 6) From a small piece of land, the farmer can get more profits by growing and selling more than one crop or animal , 7) Under good crop management, growing of different crops helps to reduce pests and diseases since different crops have different diseases and pests.For more information, call 178/0312178178.\n\nAttribution: Grameen Foundation\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-11 15:32:43\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGjBAAW","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Construction of a granary","id":"a0r70000000TGmPAAW","content":"Farmers can store produce in a well-constructed store called a granary.

This is because different maize varieties are developed to be grown in different locations and the time they take to mature is determined by the location. Maize grows well in an area that receives good rains during the growing season. Most areas (low land areas) can support two maize growing seasons per year while others can only support one maize season. This is because of scarce rains or long growing season for example in highland or mountain areas like Kapchorwa\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-10 16:29:59\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StZjAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Spacing of maize when it is planted with other crops","id":"a0r70000000TGdhAAG","content":"Maize can be planted with other crops like beans.

When using weed killers, a farmer can first spray the garden to kill the weeds and then plant maize after all the weeds have been killed, this is normally between 3 to 7days after applying the

Banana also provides feeds for animals especially the leaves. The different types of banana can also be used for different purposes for example Bogoya can be eaten when they are ripe, Sukali Ndizi  can be used to make pancakes, Mbidde can be used for making juice or beer. Also green banana can be fried to make crisps or can be dried into chips which can later be made into flour.

Steady rains are expected to set in around mid October and continue up to late November with a peak in late October to mid November when the normal season should be on a decline. End of rains is expected late November/early December. Therefore, farmers are advised to do the following: Plant long maturing crops like millet, sorghum, maize, cassava, sweet potatoes on the start of rains and short quick maturing crops  later on ( beans, tomatoes, vegetables) as rains progress. Prunning of crops like fruit trees(avocado, apples, mangoes, oranges) should be undertaken. Construction of drainage and diversion channels on crop plots and parcels incase of heavy rains. Put in place  soil conservation structures to prevent soil erosion for those on slopes and  highlands. Crop pests and diseases attacking green vegetables are likely to be common. Planting of pastures can be undertaken including the improvement of  the exist ones. Guard against tickborne diseases and worms. Advise farmers to undertake planting of trees during the good rains to act as windbreakers in future and income source. Harvesting root tube crops ( cassava, sweet potatoes) to avoid damage by heavy rains. Construct proper drainage systems around the houses to lead rainwater away. Have and use pit latrines. Use rubber shoes as there are  may be incidents of lightning. Be on look out for water borne diseases cholera  and use mosquito nets.

Stable rains are expected to increase with the highest amount occurring in around mid-April. Thereafter, the rains are expected to reduce and the  rainy season expected to end early June. The area is expected to receive the same amount of rainfall like it receives normally. Advice: Farmers should plant early, plant enough food and manage  their crops well to make use of the rain. If possible, farmers should harvest water to use during the next dry season.  People should ensure cleanliness in their homes since disease like cholera is likely to occur due to excess flooding water.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by ministry of water and environment department of meteorology\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-25 14:11:30\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SyXeAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Kibingo","id":"a0r70000000SyZiAAK","content":"Weather: Today Monday 26/11/2012, clear.

The first leaves are often yellow, later turning necrotic and finally the seedlings wilt. Fusarium infects bean roots when the soil is too wet, or too hot for good bean growth. The fungus survives in soil for long period. Farmers can control by ploughing deeply the bean residues after harvest. Practice a 6 to 8 year crop rotation without legumes. Do not feed livestock old bean straw if manure is to be used on bean fields. Plant beans in hills or ridges in heavy waterlogged soils.For more information call 178 (MTN) or 0312178178 (other networks).\n\nAttribution: information was provided by NARO and NOGAMU\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-26 17:34:40\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TCTaAAO","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"21st to 31st October 2012","id":"a0r70000000THnOAAW","content":"During the  last days of October  from 21st to 31st,2012, Kasese District is expected to be cloudy  with  still chances of  rain almost on a daily basis to some extent .Temperatures will lie between 15 to 26 degrees centigrade.

Bananas can be stored for between 21 and 30 days if they are being kept in a cool, dry place. Bunches that are packed in closed places that have warm temperatures and little air moving in them will become ripe very quickly.. It is very important that bunches do not fall or bump during transport, as this causes them to get damaged and rot. Damaged bananas or those that have started ripening will be bought at a lower price. Bananas on a bunch do not ripen at the same pace; if some bananas start ripening, they should be removed. If they are left, they will make the whole bunch to ripen in a short time.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-24 11:25:48\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000Sw2CAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Sorghum Grain","id":"a0r70000000THniAAG","content":"Retail Price: 1,800 Shs per Kg. \nWholesale Price: 1,600 Shs per Kg.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by FIT Uganda\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-24 10:56:08\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TIC5AAO","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Latanya","id":"a0r70000000TJpnAAG","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpnAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Porogali market","id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"cotton","id":"a0r70000000TJppAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 1,000 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,000 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 1,000 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 1,000 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"maize grain","id":"a0r70000000TJpqAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 650 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 700 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 450 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 500 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"agwedde beans","id":"a0r70000000TJprAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 1,200 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,300 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 900 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 1,000 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"rice","id":"a0r70000000TJpsAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 2,700 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 2,800 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 2,300 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 2,500 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"simsim","id":"a0r70000000TJptAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 2,800 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 2,900 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 2,400 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 2,500 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"dry groundnuts","id":"a0r70000000TJpuAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 1,300 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,400 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 1,100 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 1,200 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"green grams","id":"a0r70000000TJpvAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 900 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,000 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 750 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 800 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"sunflower","id":"a0r70000000TJpxAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 950 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,000 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 700 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 800 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"millet","id":"a0r70000000TJpyAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 1,300 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 1,400 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 1,100 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 1,200 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TJpoAAG","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"sorghum","id":"a0r70000000TJpwAAG","content":"Lowest Retail Price: 650 Shs per kg. \nHighest Retail Price: 700 Shs per kg.\nLowest Wholesale Price: 450 Shs per kg. \nHighest Wholesale Price: 500 Shs per kg.\n\nAttribution: NAADS Survey\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-15 13:27:23\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SykRAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Bean common mosaic virus","id":"a0r70000000SyleAAC","content":"Symptoms of bean common mosaic virus (BCMV) are folding and twisting of leaves with a light and dark green mosaic pattern.

Slash the vegetation on the land and let it dry. Do not burn the grass since burning destroys the organic matter which is needed by the bananas.  Dig the garden for the first time at least 6 weeks before planting and second ploughing at least 2 weeks before planting the banana. Ploughing two times will help other crops grown in the banana to grow well and help the farmer to get some money before the bananas can start producing when he sells these crops. If the farmer does not have time, he can plant the bananas after digging the first time and dig the second time when the bananas are already in the garden. If the garden has some dangerous weeds like coach grass, the farmer can spray with herbicides like Gramaxon or roundup. If Gramoxon is used ploughing can take place two days after spraying: Roundup requires two weeks before ploughing is done.

Prevention and control: Farmers should apply magnesium mineral supplements to the soil (these can be bought from trusted and certified agricultural stockists) BUT farmers should get advice from agricultural personnel in their area on where to buy and how to use these mineral supplements on their soil. Application of manures can also help to control this problem. NOTE: Farmers should be very careful not to confuse symptoms of some diseases with signs of inadequate soil nutrients because this may result in very huge losses.

It is white in color. These insects occur in large numbers on the undersurfaces of cassava leaves covered with large amounts of white waxy materials. The pest sucks sap from cassava leaves. As it feeds it secretes large amounts of sweet juices called honeydew which causes the growth of black mold on the plant. The blackened leaves dry up and drop. The spiraling whitefly spreads by active flight and by being transported on stem planting materials. To control the pest, the following should be carried out: Monitoring the pests should include checking for eggs on the under sides of the plant. They are usually found on young leaves. Look out for whiteflies flying up when the crop is disturbed or when you pass in the garden. Make sure that the plants are provided with enough water and manure to enable the cassava to grow very first and strong. Inter-planting cassava plants with crops such as hot pepper can help reduce white flies. The only problem is that cassava is taller than the hot pepper plants; therefore, the spacing between the two should be wider. The garden should also be kept weed free; because some weeds will allow these whiteflies to infest them. Also, weeding reduces the competition and allows the cassava to grow faster.

This pest feeds on the cassava leaves and stems and reduces the lengths of the internodes and causes the leaves to clump together into “bunchy tops”; and dry up eventually. The pest sucks sap from cassava leaves and shoot tips. The damage is more severe in the dry than in the wet season. The pest is spread by being carried by farmers on cassava stem planting materials. Control: Plant cassava stems free of mealybugs. Uproot and burn mealybug infested cassava plants. Crop rotation and fallowing. Plant early in the rainy season to allow the cassava plants a good growth before the dry season. Strong plants are more likely to withstand pest attacks.  Apply mulch to avoid moisture stress in sandy or poor soils.  Avoid using infested plant material. Before planting cuttings can be treated with hot water [by dipping them in warm water at 50o C for 5-10 minutes just before planting] to kill all insects/mites and to avoid transfer into the newly planted field.

It is caused by a bacterium which occurs inside cassava stems.  The disease can be controlled through selecting stem cuttings from healthy plants. Infected plants should be pruned to allow for new regrowth or uprooted and burnt.  If complete outbreaks on the farm are observed it may be necessary to harvest roots immediately and destroy stems and leaves and other plant debris through burning or ploughing deep into soil. Land must be allowed to rest for few years (3 years minimum) before cassava is planted again. Tools used to cut infected plants should be cleaned after use to prevent spread of the bacterium. Crop rotation can help in controlling the spread of this disease.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-07-05 17:03:16\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SyXOAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Arua","id":"a0r70000000T9hxAAC","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-11-25 07:00:01\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T9hxAAC","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Logiri","id":"a0r70000000T9hyAAC","content":"Weather: Today Sunday 25/11/2012, cloudy.

Before the polythene is used to make a pit (hole) for collecting water, it should be cut from one side to make it open. When it is opened, the polythene will be 5ft wide. However, the 5ft cannot cover the whole pit (hole) from one side to the other.  To cover the whole pit (hole), the farmer will need to join many pieces of polythene to make a wide piece. The length of each piece of polythene will depend on the width of the pit (hole). To know the length of each piece, you need to know the distance from one side of the pit (hole) to the other including the depth on both sides and add 2ft on each side for the polythene that will cover the top sides of the pit (hole). For example if the pit (hole) is 10ft wide and 7ft deep the length of each piece will be 2+7+10+7+2 =28ft. The 2ft are for the part of the polythene that will cover the top sides of the pit (hole), the 7ft is for the polythene to cover the walls of the pit (hole) the and the 10ft is for the polythene that will cover the bottom of the pit (hole). Therefore when making this pit (hole), cut pieces measuring 28ft each. To know how many pieces you need to make the pit (hole), you need to know the distance from one side of the pit (hole) to the other along the long side including the two walls of the pit (hole) and the 2ft to cover the top sides of the pit (hole) on both sides. For example, if the pit (hole) is 20ft long and 7ft deep, this distance will be 2+7+20+7+2=38ft. Divide this by 5 (width of each piece) to know how many pieces are needed.   For example 38 divide by 5 = 8. This means to make a pit (hole) measuring 20ft long, 10ft wide and 7ft deep one will need 8 pieces of polythene each measuring 28ft long.  This means the total amount of polythene needed for a pit (hole) measuring 20ft long, by 10ft wide and 7ft deep is 8 pieces multiplied by 28ft (the length of each piece). This gives 224ft. therefore the farmer will need 224ft of polythene to make a pit (hole) of 20ft long by 10ft by and 7ft deep.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by Kathende Harambe Training Centre and Biovision\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 13:29:19\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":null,"menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Water Harvesting","id":"a0r70000000T8eLAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-01 11:56:28\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T8eQAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Places from which rain water can be harvested","id":"a0r70000000T8efAAC","content":"Rain water can be harvested from house roofs, large rocks, roads, and big trees.

If damage on roots is too much the banana plant may fall down. signs of nematodes include black patches or spots on roots, roots rotting and dying, plants growing more slowly than usual, the banana plants will form small bunches with thin fingers, and in some serious cases banana plants will fall over when a bunch is formed. Banana plants attacked by nematodes are generally weak and will easily fall over even with little pushing. Prevention and control: Farmers should plant banana types that are not easily attacked Nematodes. Farmers must use planting materials that are free from nematodes. Suckers that are to be planted can be dipped in hot water at 52-55C (water that is hot for the farmer to put his hand) for 20 minutes or in boiling water for 30 seconds. Banana plants that have been attacked by nematodes should be removed from the garden. There are also some chemical pesticides that farmers can use to control nematodes BUT farmers must seek advice from agricultural personnel in their area on which pesticide to use and how to use them. Chemicals should only be used when all the other methods have not worked.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by IITA/NARO\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-30 13:24:58\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000StRpAAK","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Diseases","id":"a0r70000000SykRAAS","content":"No Content \n\nLast Updated: \n2012-06-26 16:33:24\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000SykRAAS","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Common blight","id":"a0r70000000SykqAAC","content":"The common blight produces symptoms on leaves, pods, stems and seeds.

It cooks quickly with thick sauce. It is not easily attacked by diseases like Bean common mosaic virus disease, black rot and anthracnose. Plant at a spacing of 30cm x 5cm putting one seed per hole or plant at a spacing of 60cm x 10cm putting two seeds per hole. Planting should be done on a weed free fine seedbed at a depth of 3- 5 cm to give a population of over 200,000 Plants per hectare when there is enough moisture in the soil. Excessive moisture may lead to rotting of the seeds or diseased seedlings at an early stage. Plan the planting in such a way that harvesting is during dry period.

Pick a small part of this powder with your thumb and first finger and put it in the funnel of each maize plant. When to apply this mixture: Observe the maize for the signs of stalk borers at least once in three days two weeks after planting. Apply the mixture when you see small holes on the maize leaves. Continue applying if you see new holes on the leaves.

Desmodium is a good plant because it stops striga from growing; it puts nitrogen back into the soil; it is a very good feed crop for dairy cows; and it acts as mulch by covering the surface to prevent water loss and soil erosion.\n\nAttribution: Information provided by NARO and Agricultural Sector Programme Support\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-10-08 16:03:06\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000TGPkAAO","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Other common weeds in maize and their effects","id":"a0r70000000TGRbAAO","content":"Other common weeds that farmers should look out for are couch grass, milk weed, black jack, wondering jew, star grass, oxalis, spear grass and Galisonga (Galant soldier).

Signs and symptom The signs maize smut disease includes the seeds on the cob becoming black and big with a black powdery substance inside. The affected maize does not develop seeds on the cob. The black powder can also be on the tassles or flowers as well. Prevention and control You can control this disease by planting seeds that do not have the disease or seeds that have been treated. These can be bought from certified seed companies. Removing the black swellings from the maize head or the flower as soon as you see them will avoid the disease from spreading.

These insects usually attack maize when it is planted late in the season. Signs and symptoms The disease has the following signs: Small round scattered spots which start appearing on the youngest leaves. This happens within a week after maize has been infected with the virus. As the number of spots increases and the plant grows, the spots become larger and develop into small broken lines running in the same direction to the leaf veins. When the spots become very many, leaf bases and fully grown leaves lose their green colour. Infected maize may grow slowly and if it is affected early it will not develop cobs or will die while it is still very young. Prevention and control You can control this disease by: Planting varieties that are resistant to the disease such as longe 10H and longe 7H and farmers should avoid planting seeds of maize harvested from the previous seasons. Planting earlier in the season will help the crops to escape from the leaf hoppers.

It is suitable for lowlands and medium land areas. Plant at a spacing of 30cm x 5cm putting one seed per hole or at a spacing of 60cm x 10cm putting two seeds per hole. Planting should be done on a weed free fine seedbed at a depth of 3- 5cm to give a population of over 200,000 Plants per hectare when there is enough moisture in the soil. Excessive moisture may lead to rotting of the seeds or diseased seedlings at an early stage. Plan the planting in such a way that harvesting is during dry period. It matures between 85 to 90days.  To plant one hectare you will need between 90kgs to 100kgs of bean seed. If managed well, it can yield between 2 to 2.5 tons per hectare.\n\nLast Updated: \n2012-08-17 09:18:41\n\n"},{"position":null,"parent_id":"a0r70000000T9QJAA0","menu_id":"a0Y70000002okHLEAY","label":"Ogur","id":"a0r70000000T9QxAAK","content":"Weather: Today Monday 26/11/2012, cloudy.
